"""Shared model matrix and assertions for one/two-card weight-update E2Es.

The oracle these suites share is *normal startup loading of the payload*, not the
first live update: a temporary checkpoint is written from the very same
generator the transfer ships, a reference server loads it at startup, and every
live-update lane has to reproduce that reference exactly. Comparing two live
updates with each other could only prove the transfer is *deterministic*; a
transfer that consistently drops, renames or reshapes parameters would still
pass. See ``assert_weight_update_matches_reference``.

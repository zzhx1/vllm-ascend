# KDA state copy: PR #17301-aligned Triton integration

## Scope and dispatch

The worker selects by device and cache layout without an additional configuration
or environment switch. A5/950 with FP32/BF16, positive `[N,H,V,K]`, dense inner
payload and nonoverlapping cache pages uses the fused plan. A3/non-950 and
unsupported layouts use a masked byte-copy plan prepared during startup.
Triton replaces the native gather/clear and scatter kernels on eligible A5
caches, not chunk math, recurrent decode, GLM KDA or unrelated kernels.

Flow: worker binds cache -> choose fused / masked byte-copy fallback
-> prepare disposable samples -> seal all plans -> publish -> prefill gather ->
unchanged chunk math -> scatter. Preparation failure aborts startup; it must not
silently publish a partially ready worker.

Both V1 and V2 runners invoke initialization after cache binding. A Kimi layer
cannot serve until initialization has completed. Unsupported contiguous and
strided caches both use the PR's byte-pointer copy algorithm with a startup-precompiled
batch-memcpy launcher. The fallback uses Torch clearing to avoid a second lazy Triton kernel.
Invalid inner layouts remain rejected by the strided fallback, as in the PR.

## Numerical contract

- Fused gather produces zero for invalid indices and false initial-state flags.
  Missing flags mean all valid rows are gathered. Repeated gather indices work.
- Fused/byte-copy scatter skips invalid indices; valid destinations must be
  unique. Initial-state flags do not suppress final writes.
- Cache page gaps and layer storage offsets are not copied or overwritten.
  Address arithmetic widens to INT64 before multiplication, including INT32
  index inputs and pages more than 4 GiB apart.
- Packed outputs have the cache dtype. Final states are converted to that dtype
  and contiguous storage before scatter, as in PR #17301.
- Empty selections validate metadata and do not launch a copy kernel.
- Cache/packed storage must not overlap. Concurrent writers require upstream
  coordination. These are caller preconditions, not synchronizing host scans.
- The fallback gathers invalid indices as zero and skips invalid scatter
  destinations, including contiguous unsupported caches.

## Startup preparation and no serving recompilation

`KDAStateCopyPlan` prepares exactly four compiled variants per bound cache layout:
INT32/INT64 indices multiplied by gather/scatter. All variants use fixed cache
metadata and block size 8192. Gather flags are aligned contiguous BOOL. Index
values and selected counts are runtime data; launch grid is rebound without a
JIT call. `0 <= selected <= scheduler.max_num_seqs` does not expand the plan variant table.

Preparation uses one disposable payload row and small metadata tensors. The
actual row count, stride and alignment are scalar/layout information only; all
kernel pointers refer to scratch allocations. Index zero ensures the scratch
never needs to span the live cache. Startup synchronizes before releasing it.
The strided fallback separately prepares one byte-copy variant with scratch
source/destination pointers, not live cache pointers.

Serving invokes only stored compiled objects. An unsealed plan, changed cache
layout, excess selected count, or unexpected JIT hook is rejected before launch.
No request can add a variant or evict one. Different worker layouts require
reinitialization; equal layouts may share plans. Plans retain no request tensors,
stream handles or live data pointers.

Aligned contiguous INT32 inputs remain INT32: no per-call INT64 conversion.
Strided/misaligned metadata is normalized only when needed, preserving dtype.
This bounded normalization avoids treating arbitrary strides/alignment classes
as new compiler signatures. Pointer addresses and metadata values can change.
The current stream is resolved by the compiled launcher for each invocation.

### Compiler-environment contract

Compiler environment/version snapshots are compared during `prepare`/`seal`,
not scanned on every gather/scatter. Changing compiler environment, backend
binaries or loaded implementation after startup is unsupported: restart and
prepare again. This is a deliberate change from the previous strict wrapper's
per-call drift detection. It does **not** make a stored compiled object capable
of JIT compilation, nor does it remove tensor-layout validation.

Do not reintroduce per-copy `os.environ` enumeration, or convert every INT32
index tensor to INT64 simply to minimize startup variant count. Both were
measured regressions in the preceding implementation.

## Dynamo and FakeTensor boundary

Eager plan calls keep the direct compiled launch. During Dynamo tracing, plans
bound by worker initialization emit `vllm::kda_state_gather` and
`vllm::kda_state_scatter`. Their Fake implementations validate pointer-free
metadata and model output allocation / cache mutation. Actual execution resolves
the sealed plan from the current forward context's `no_compile_layers`, as other
Ascend custom ops do. No extra global plan registry or runtime compilation is
introduced. Standalone `prepare()` plans without a worker binding are eager/graph
APIs, not exportable layer-context handles.

These are not ABI replacements for `_C_ascend::kda_state_copy`; they preserve the
prefill copy semantics through a worker-owned lifecycle. Tests cover FakeTensor,
`torch.compile(backend="eager", fullgraph=True, dynamic=True)`, and NPU graph
replay of the traced callable, including FP16 strided fallback. They do not prove
full-model compilation or every compilation backend.

## Validation

CPU tests cover device/layout routing, startup deduplication,
all-or-nothing publication and actual prefill dispatch. NPU integration tests
cover optional exact FP32/BF16 comparisons with a separately built PR17301 native operator,
INT32/INT64, dynamic selected counts, gaps/offsets, invalid indices, graph replay,
real prefill/chunk math, and the FP16 strided byte-copy fallback.

Formal serving tests replace the KDA JIT entry and compiler APIs with functions
that fail immediately. Fallback tests also disable the byte-copy JIT entry.
The suite separately asserts that aligned INT32 inputs retain their identity
and serving never invokes the compiler-environment scanner. Changing selected
counts and graph input values must succeed with a constant variant table.

Run the integration and independent plan-copy suites together; the latter
uses test-local worker-owned plans and a compiler-denying fixture:

```bash
python -m pytest --confcutdir=tests/ut/ops \
  tests/ut/ops/test_kda_state_copy_lifecycle.py \
  tests/ut/ops/test_kda_state_copy_integration.py \
  tests/ut/ops/test_kimi_kda.py
python -m pytest --confcutdir=tests/e2e/nightly/single_node/ops/singlecard_ops \
  tests/e2e/nightly/single_node/ops/singlecard_ops/test_kda_state_copy_integration.py \
  tests/e2e/nightly/single_node/ops/singlecard_ops/test_kda_state_copy_triton.py
```

## Performance acceptance and remaining boundaries

Use identical inputs and allocation boundaries for native versus Triton
production calls. Include output allocation, necessary metadata work and final
state conversion. Compare old and new implementations in the same process and
rotate order. Record eager Event, synchronized wall time, and graph replay
separately; an Event interval includes host dispatch gaps, not just kernel time.
A historical preallocated operator benchmark is a secondary reference, not a
substitute for production-wrapper timing.

Local tests are not full model-server, TP/PP, concurrency, sleep/wake or generation
quality acceptance. The native comparison reuses the installed extension and is
not a clean Ascend C build. Non-950 fallback is code-routed but requires
additional hardware validation. Full-model compilation/Inductor acceptance is
not established by operator tracing tests. The no-JIT guarantee here covers
prepared state-copy routes, not unrelated model kernels.

There is one lifecycle: `KDAStateCopyPlan.prepare` compiles four variants on
scratch, `seal` validates startup configuration, and the worker publishes only
after all layer plans are ready. Tests instantiate the same plan independently.
`ops/triton/kda_state_copy_kernel.py` retains only the kernel and common metadata
validation, not a process-global launcher registry, signature budget, lock,
per-call environment scan, or mutation of the JIT object's `run` method.

Previous standalone-only policy tests were migrated as follows:

| Old assertion | Unified-lifecycle assertion |
|---|---|
| global empty registry / irreversible global seal | unsealed plan rejects use; independent plans may prepare and seal |
| unknown signature, tensor identity, dynamic grid | cache layout/alignment checked; same-layout rebinding and dynamic S reuse four variants |
| global 128-signature budget / block-size overrides | canceled: finite worker layout set and fixed 8192 block replace user-specified signature budget |
| metadata errors / empty selection | invalid layout and metadata reject before compile/launch; S=0 launches nothing |
| per-call compiler-environment drift | canceled: prepare/seal checks drift; serving must not scan configuration |
| global `kernel.run` replacement | canceled: compiled launch object only; compiler entry denied in tests |

`test_kda_state_copy_lifecycle.py` tests the production plan with isolated host
stubs. `test_kda_state_copy_triton.py` retains the original numerical assertions
but invokes sealed production plans rather than a standalone registry.

### Reproducible paired performance check

The optional native differential tests skip only when the separately built
PR #17301 reference op is absent; all independent correctness tests remain
required. Production does not depend on that op. The benchmark requires it
explicitly and fails early if unavailable:

```bash
python -m tests.e2e.nightly.single_node.ops.singlecard_ops.benchmark_kda_state_copy_triton \
  --output /tmp/kda-round-1.json --seed 41 --trials 100
```

Use a fresh process and a new output file for each seed. The benchmark includes
production allocation, a native predicate ablation, equal preallocated
boundaries, and two labels for the identical native callable as a measurement
control. Every trial shuffles order. Output lifetimes end outside the timed
intervals. It records all raw samples and implementation hashes, denies Triton
compiler entry after warmup, and reports host enqueue, synchronized wall, eager
Event and 100-call graph replay separately. Never interpret eager Event as pure
kernel time or combine different rounds/modes by subtracting their medians.

# split_qkv_rmsnorm_rope_vnorm

## Description

- **Function**: Fused pre-attention stage for models that normalize V. In a single Triton kernel it splits the fused QKV projection, applies per-head RMSNorm to Q, K and V, applies NeoX-style RoPE to Q and K, and stores the three tensors separately. It replaces the host-side chain of `split` × 1, `npu_rms_norm` × 3 and `npu_rotary_embedding` × 1, which wrote every intermediate back to global memory. `split_qkv_rmsnorm_rope` cannot serve these models because it copies V out of the fused tensor without normalizing it.
- **Formula**:
    - Input `input`: `[num_tokens, q_hidden_size + 2 * kv_hidden_size]`, laid out as `[ q \| k \| v ]`.
    - Split by column offset (`q_hidden_size`, `kv_hidden_size`, `kv_hidden_size`):
        - `q`: `[num_tokens, q_head_num, head_dim]`
        - `k`: `[num_tokens, kv_head_num, head_dim]`
        - `v`: `[num_tokens, kv_head_num, head_dim]` (normed, no RoPE)
    - RMSNorm over the head dimension (`D = head_dim`), reduction in float32:
        - `rstd = rsqrt(sum(x^2) / D + eps)`
        - `q, k`: `y = x * rstd * w [+ b]` with the learnable scale `w` (`q_weight` / `k_weight`)
        - `v`: `y = x * rstd`, no scale, no bias, matching `RMSNorm(head_dim, has_weight=False)`
    - NeoX RoPE over the first `R = rope_dim` elements of each head (`half = R // 2`), applied to the **normed** Q and K only (`y` is the output of the RMSNorm step above); V is stored without rotation:
        - `y1 = y[..., :half]`, `y2 = y[..., half:R]`
        - `rotated = [y1 * cos - y2 * sin, y2 * cos + y1 * sin]`
        - `out = [rotated, y[..., R:]]`; the tail beyond `R` passes through un-rotated, which only occurs when `rope_dim < head_dim`
        - `cos`/`sin` are the per-position rows gathered from `cos_sin_cache` (`[max_position, rope_dim] = concat(cos, sin)`); `cos` is a row of `[0, rope_dim/2)` and `sin` is a row of `[rope_dim/2, rope_dim)`.
- **Algorithm flow** (processed token by token, independently):
    1. Launch with `grid = (num_vectorcore,)`; each vector core owns a contiguous range of `cdiv(num_tokens, num_vectorcore)` tokens and handles the full hidden dimension for them.
    2. Size a UB-aware token tile (`batch_size_per_iter_per_vec`) from the UB budget (`UB_SIZE = 85 KB`) and a per-token element factor, so every buffer of the tile stays resident.
    3. One loop over token tiles, sharing the two norm weights (loaded once into registers):
        - Load the whole fused row `[ q \| k \| v ]` in one masked load and view it head-major as `[tile * (q_head_num + 2 * kv_head_num), head_dim]`.
        - Gather `cos_sin_cache[positions]` once per tile into `[tile, rope_dim]` (`get_element` + `insert_slice`), then split into `cos` / `sin` broadcast over every head.
        - Run **one** RMSNorm reduction (`tl.sum` over `head_dim`, accumulated in float32) covering every Q, K and V head of the tile.
        - Slice Q (head offset `0`), K (offset `q_head_num`) and V (offset `q_head_num + kv_head_num`) with `extract_slice`; apply `q_weight` / `k_weight` (and optional biases) and NeoX RoPE to Q and K; store V directly.
    4. All intermediates stay in UB/registers; global memory is touched only on input load and output store.
- **Supported modes**: Atlas A2 (Triton kernel). Atlas A3 takes the same `BaseDeviceAdaptor` dispatch path but has not been validated. Applied by `QKVNormRopeFusionPattern` in `vllm_ascend/compilation/passes/qknorm_rope_fusion_pass.py`, which rewrites the unfused q/k norm, RoPE and weight-less v norm chain when `HAS_TRITON`, the hardware profile supports `HardwareCapability.GRAPH_QKV_NORM_ROPE_FUSION` (Atlas A2/A3), the model dtype is bf16, and one token's tiles fit a vector core. The pass registers one pattern per distinct attention shape, so models alternating attention types (Gemma4: sliding `head_dim=256`, full attention `head_dim=512`) fuse both. Layers that share KV never match, because they do not build the k/v norms. Requires a compiled path; under `enforce_eager` no fusion pass runs. **Not supported on Ascend 950**: that platform routes `split_qkv_rmsnorm_rope` to a SIMT kernel that replaces the in-kernel scalar cos/sin gather with a pre-gathered buffer, and no SIMT variant of this operator exists yet. Its profile therefore lacks `GRAPH_QKV_NORM_ROPE_FUSION`, so the pass does not register the pattern there and those layers stay unfused.

## Constraints

- `input.dtype` must be `bfloat16`, as must `q_weight`, `k_weight` and `cos_sin_cache`; the kernel holds its cos/sin, norm and RoPE buffers as `tl.bfloat16`, so the fused path is only taken for bf16.
- `input` must be 2-D `[num_tokens, hidden]`; `num_tokens` is flattened from `batch * seq_len` by the caller.
- `positions` must be 1-D of `int64`, with every element `< max_position_embeddings` (the row count of `cos_sin_cache`).
- `head_dim > 0`, and both `q_hidden_size` and `kv_hidden_size` must be exact multiples of `head_dim`. The kernel reinterprets the loaded row head-major, so a remainder would misalign the per-head reduction and the Q/K/V slice offsets.
- `rope_dim` is the last dim of `cos_sin_cache` and must be even and `<= head_dim`. RoPE rotates only the first `rope_dim` elements of each head; the rest is copied unchanged.
- The RoPE cache must be NeoX style: `cos_sin_cache[p]` holds `cos` then `sin`, each `rope_dim / 2` wide.
- RMSNorm is applied to `q`, `k` and `v`; only `q` and `k` take a learnable scale and an optional bias, and only `q` and `k` are rotated. A single `eps` is shared by all three.
- One token's buffers must fit a single vector core's UB. `qkv_rmsnorm_rope_vnorm_fits_ub(q_hidden_size, kv_hidden_size, head_dim, rope_dim)` reports this and callers must fall back to the unfused chain when it returns `False`. The budget is per TP rank, so a larger tensor parallel size makes more layers eligible.
- `q_hidden_size`, `kv_hidden_size`, `head_dim`, `eps` and all tile sizes are compile-time `constexpr`; `num_tokens` is dynamic (the token loop and masks handle arbitrary token counts).
- Only for NPU inference (prefill/decode).

## Origin and Differences

- **Origin**: Derived from `vllm_ascend/ops/triton/linearnorm/split_qkv_rmsnorm_rope.py`. The Q/K stage (grid, UB tiling, per-tile cos/sin gather, `extract_slice` / `insert_slice` RoPE and partial-RoPE handling) is inherited from it, with the head-major view widened from `q_head_num + kv_head_num` to `q_head_num + 2 * kv_head_num` so the V heads share it.
- **Differences**:
    - Modified for a specific vllm-ascend logic or different input parameters: V is normalized per head with a weight-less RMSNorm instead of being copied out of the fused tensor, which is what Gemma4 requires (`RMSNorm(head_dim, has_weight=False)`). The base operator's unfused replacement for these models would leave the V norm as a separate op.
    - NPU adaptation for performance: because V now needs the same float32 reduction scratch as Q and K, the separate wide-tile V loop that the base operator uses for a plain copy no longer pays for itself. V is folded into the Q/K loop, so a single RMSNorm reduction covers every Q, K and V head of the tile and each token's input arrives as one contiguous load instead of two disjoint column ranges. The UB tiling factor widens accordingly: the loaded slice and its float32 copy grow from `q + kv` to `q + 2 * kv` elements, plus one bfloat16 copy of the V output. `qkv_rmsnorm_rope_vnorm_fits_ub` exposes the resulting per-token budget so callers can resolve eligibility before the kernel is reached.

## Test Cases

- Single-operator accuracy test: `tests/e2e/nightly/single_node/ops/singlecard_ops/triton/test_split_qkv_rmsnorm_rope_vnorm.py`, parameterized over real `gemma-4-31B-it` per-rank shapes: sliding layers (`head_dim=256`, 32 Q / 16 KV heads) and full attention layers (`head_dim=512`, 32 Q / 4 KV heads), each divided by the tensor parallel size. Both the no-bias and the with-bias paths are covered. `rope_dim == head_dim` throughout, because `Gemma4RotaryEmbedding` passes `rotary_dim = head_size` to the base class and therefore builds a full-width cos/sin cache even on proportional-RoPE layers.
- Fusion-pass test: `tests/e2e/pull_request/one_card/compile/test_graphex_qkvnorm_rope_fusion.py`, which compiles the pre-attention chain for both Gemma4 shapes and asserts the graph holds `qkv_rmsnorm_rope_vnorm` and no leftover `npu_rms_norm` or `npu_rotary_embedding`. The variant built from the real `RMSNorm` and `get_rope` modules also checks that each attention type gets its Ascend rotary embedding, and that the fused outputs match the same modules run eagerly.
- Pass registration unit test: `tests/ut/compilation/test_qknorm_rope_fusion_pass.py`, which checks that the two Gemma4 shapes produce distinct pattern keys (a shared key would silently drop the second registration), that the pass registers one pattern per distinct attention shape, that a shape overflowing the unified buffer is skipped, and that hardware without the kernel (Ascend 950) skips this pattern while keeping the q/k-only ones.
- Precision tolerance follows the operator-type/data-type convention: bf16 normalization plus rotation uses `atol=5e-2, rtol=5e-3` against a float32 reference, matching `test_split_qkv_rmsnorm_rope.py`. The fused vs unfused comparison in the fusion-pass test compares two bf16 results that round at different points, so it allows a few bf16 ulps (`atol=1e-1, rtol=2e-2`).

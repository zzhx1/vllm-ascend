    """Routed-path milestones consumed by shared-expert work.

    The milestones describe execution phases instead of a communication
    backend. Their meaning therefore stays stable across routed MoE paths:

    * AllGather performs its distributed input gather in ``prepare()``, before
      ``routed_dispatch_start``.  Its token dispatch/combine are local routing
      ops, followed by a distributed reduce-scatter in ``finalize()``.
    * All2All performs local pad/split work in ``prepare()``.  Its forward and
      reverse EP exchanges start after ``routed_dispatch_start`` and
      ``routed_combine_start``, respectively.
    * Fused routed implementations may expose no intermediate stage events.
      Shared experts then fall back to one concurrent auxiliary-stream
      workload without depending on a specific communication backend.

    Shared Gate-Up starts at ``router_output_ready``.  It can consequently
    cover the routed input AllGather, or All2All preprocessing plus its forward
    exchange, without embedding communication-type branches in the shared
    expert implementation.

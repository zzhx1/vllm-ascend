"""Patch DSpark draft loading to inherit the target quant config.

DSpark supports two kinds of drafts:

* Self-contained drafts (e.g. Qwen3 DSpark speculators) ship their own weights
  and ``quantization_config``; ``get_draft_quant_config`` resolves their own
  quant scheme and must be left alone.
* Same-checkpoint drafts (DeepSeek-V4 DSpark, weights under ``mtp.*``) declare
  no quantization of their own, but reuse the target weights. Upstream
  ``load_dspark_model`` derives the draft quant config via
  ``get_draft_quant_config``, which returns ``None`` here. That builds an
  unquantized draft, and a W4A8/W8A8 target checkpoint cannot be loaded into it
  (the draft linear layers lack the ``weight_offset``/``weight_scale``/
  ``scale_bias`` params the checkpoint ships), failing with a KeyError.

The same-checkpoint fix is a general one; a long-term plan exists to contribute
it upstream to ``load_dspark_model``.

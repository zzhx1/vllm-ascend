# This module manage the patch for vllm. There are two folders in this module:
# - platform: contains the patches applied before worker starts. It's called by
#             `vllm_ascend.utils.adapt_patch(is_global_patch=True)` in
#             `vllm_ascend.platform.NPUPlatform.pre_register_and_update()` function.
# - worker: contains the patches applied when worker starts. It's called by
#           `vllm_ascend.utils.adapt_patch(is_global_patch=False)` in
#           each worker's `__init__` function.
#
# Once a new patch is added in vllm-ascend, please add the patch description into this file as well.

# What's Patched and how it works:
# --------------------------------
# * Platform Patch:
# =================
# Entries are listed in alphabetical order by file name.
#
# ** 1. File: platform/patch_balance_schedule.py**
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#   1. `vllm.v1.engine.core.EngineCoreProc.run_engine_core`
#      `vllm.v1.core.sched.scheduler.Scheduler`
#    Why:
#       vLLM v1 scheduling currently enables chunkedprefill by default, which processes prefill and decode
#       requests simultaneously in a single scheduling session. This can impact the overall system throughput
#       and performance in some scenarios.
#    How：
#       Set --additional-config '{"enable_balance_scheduling": true}' or
#       set environmental variable VLLM_ASCEND_BALANCE_SCHEDULING=1 (deprecated).
#    Related PR (if no, explain why):
#       https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/29721
#    Future Plan:
#       Remove this patch when vLLM merge the PR.
#
# ** 3. File: platform/patch_distributed.py**
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#   1. `torch.distributed.all_reduce`, `torch.distributed.broadcast`
#    Why:
#       tensor alignment for 310p
#    How：
#       rewrite all_reduce and broadcast in torch.distributed
#    Related PR (if no, explain why):
#       No, not ready yet.
#    Future Plan:
#       Find a better way to support tensor alignment for 310p without this patch.
#
# ** 4. File: platform/patch_dp_device_ids.py**
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#   1. `vllm.v1.core.dp_utils.get_physical_gpu_ids_for_local_dp_rank`
#    Why:
#       PR #45026 removed the per-process device isolation that older vLLM
#       versions performed internally. Application-level DP (e.g.
#       `offline_data_parallel.py`) now has to slice ASCEND_RT_VISIBLE_DEVICES
#       per rank itself, but the upstream helper still expects the env var to
#       contain ALL devices for ALL ranks and tries to read it with the
#       `local_dp_rank * world_size` offset. With a sharded env var, that
#       offset is out of range and the helper raises IndexError (wrapped in the
#       user-facing "Error computing device indices for ..." message).
#    How：
#       Patch `get_physical_gpu_ids_for_local_dp_rank` so it tolerates a
#       pre-sharded ASCEND_RT_VISIBLE_DEVICES env var (one slice per DP rank),
#       instead of unconditionally applying `local_dp_rank * world_size` as an
#       offset into it.
#    Related PR (if no, explain why):
#       https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/45026
#    Future Plan:
#       Remove this patch once upstream `get_physical_gpu_ids_for_local_dp_rank`
#       handles a pre-sharded visible-devices env var, or vLLM-Ascend stops
#       relying on application-level device slicing for DP.
#
# ** 5. File: platform/patch_dyntra_lb_core.py**
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#   1. `vllm.v1.engine.core.EngineCoreProc.run_engine_core`
#      `vllm.v1.engine.core.DPEngineCoreProc`
#    Why:
#       PD-disaggregated decoder serving can develop uneven attention KV-cache
#       workloads across data-parallel ranks. Upstream vLLM does not currently
#       expose an extension point for selecting an Ascend-specific DP engine
#       core that coordinates dynamic cross-rank scheduling decisions.
#    How:
#       When DyntraLB is enabled, replace the DP engine-core process with the
#       DyntraLB implementation at engine startup. The implementation exchanges
#       lightweight scheduling metadata across DP ranks and applies the
#       resulting admission, pause, and resume decisions through the DyntraLB
#       scheduler while preserving the original path when the feature is off.
#    Related PR (if no, explain why):
#       https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/12292
#    Future Plan:
#       Remove this patch after upstream vLLM provides stable scheduler and DP
#       engine-core plugin interfaces, or equivalent dynamic intra-decoder DP
#       load balancing that vllm-ascend can use without monkey-patching.
#
# ** 6. File: platform/patch_eplb.py**
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#   1. `vllm.config.parallel.current_platform`
#   2. `vllm.distributed.eplb.eplb_state._move_to_workspace`
#    Why:
#       Upstream EPLB owns the Model Runner V2 control plane, but its platform
#       capability check excludes NPU. Its async workspace move also has no
#       downstream callback after a per-layer map commit.
#    How:
#       Expose EPLB capability only inside vllm.config.parallel and refresh the
#       Ascend lookup after an async layer commit. Router behavior and load
#       scope are owned by downstream instances rather than patched upstream
#       classes; upstream torch.distributed communication runs over HCCL.
#    Related PR (if no, explain why):
#       https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/49700
#    Related RFC:
#       https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/49702
#    Future Plan:
#       Remove this patch once the upstream `EplbPlatformBackend` interface is
#       available in the supported vLLM version. Retain only the NPU backend,
#       operator, communicator, load normalization, and weight views.
#
# ** 7. File: platform/patch_fused_moe.py**
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#   1. `vllm.model_executor.layers.fused_moe.FusedMoEFactory`
#    Why:
#       vllm's MoE factory function (formerly FusedMoE, now FusedMoEFactory on main).
#       deepseek_v2 and other models do
#       `from vllm.model_executor.layers.fused_moe import FusedMoEFactory`
#       and call it directly, so on Ascend we must redirect it to AscendMoERunner
#       before any model is imported.
#    How：
#       Patch the FusedMoEFactory binding in both the package `__init__` and the layer
#       module so model imports pick up the Ascend runner. `worker/patch_fused_moe.py`
#       reuses this platform patch to avoid double-wrapping the factory during
#       worker initialization.
#    Related PR (if no, explain why):
#       No, vllm-ascend-specific MoE runner integration.
#    Future Plan:
#       Remove this patch once upstream exposes a backend dispatch / plugin hook
#       for selecting the MoE runner implementation.
#
# ** 7a. File: platform/patch_glm5next_config.py**
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#   1. `vllm.transformers_utils.config._CONFIG_REGISTRY`
#    Why:
#       The GLM-5.3-Flash architecture is maintained in vllm-ascend
#       (`vllm_ascend/models/glm5next/`) rather than upstream, so its config
#       classes are not in vLLM's `model_type` lookup table. Without an entry,
#       loading a GLM-5.3-Flash checkpoint fails to resolve `glm5_next`.
#    How：
#       Insert `Glm5NextConfig` / `Glm5NextTextConfig` / `Glm5NextVisionConfig`
#       into `_CONFIG_REGISTRY`. The registry is a `LazyConfigDict` whose values
#       may be either a module attribute name or the class itself, so the
#       downstream classes are inserted directly.
#    Related PR (if no, explain why):
#       No. The upstream GLM-5.3-Flash PR (vllm-project/vllm#53906) is not
#       merged, and vllm-ascend carries the architecture downstream instead of
#       depending on it.
#    Future Plan:
#       Remove this patch once the supported vLLM version registers the
#       GLM-5.3-Flash configs itself.
#
#   2. `vllm.config.model.ModelConfig.is_deepseek_mla`
#    Why:
#       GLM-5.3-Flash uses MLA, but upstream decides `is_deepseek_mla` from a
#       hard-coded `model_type` tuple that cannot know about a downstream
#       architecture. Answering False routes the model down the non-MLA KV cache
#       and quantization paths.
#    How：
#       Wrap the property so it additionally returns True for `glm5_next` /
#       `glm5_next_text` when the text config carries `kv_lora_rank`, preserving
#       upstream behavior for every other model type.
#    Related PR (if no, explain why):
#       No, see above.
#    Future Plan:
#       Remove this patch once upstream either includes the GLM-5.3-Flash
#       model types or resolves MLA from the config contents instead of a
#       model_type whitelist.
#
# ** 8. File: platform/patch_kv_cache_coordinator.py**
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#   1. `vllm.v1.core.kv_cache_coordinator.HybridKVCacheCoordinator.find_longest_cache_hit_per_group`
#    Why:
#       In PD disaggregation with hybrid Mamba models, the D side receives
#       FullAttention KV blocks from the P side but has no local prefix-cache
#       hit for Mamba groups. Upstream's min-reduction across all KV groups
#       collapses the FullAttention hit length to 0, preventing partial
#       FullAttention-only prefix cache reuse on the D side.
#    How:
#       For Mamba hybrid models,
#       num_new_local_computed_tokens should be the FA hit
#       length. This value is passed to the connector's
#       get_num_new_matched_tokens which computes:
#       external = total - local_computed.
#       Using the FA hit skips re-transferring FA blocks
#       already cached on D-side.
#    Related PR (if no, explain why):
#       https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/42524
#       https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/44243
#    Future Plan:
#       Remove this patch when vLLM PR #42524 and #44243 is included in the supported
#       upstream vLLM version.
#
# ** 9. File: platform/patch_kv_cache_utils.py**
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#   1. `vllm.v1.core.kv_cache_utils.resolve_kv_cache_block_sizes`
#      `vllm.v1.engine.core.resolve_kv_cache_block_sizes`
#    Why:
#       vLLM PR #40860 added a restriction that hybrid KV cache groups with
#       multiple block sizes do not support decode context parallelism.
#       This restriction is correct for CUDA but not for Ascend, which
#       implements context parallelism for MLA and SWA-MLA layers separately.
#    How：
#       Monkey-patch resolve_kv_cache_block_sizes to handle the multiple-groups
#       + DCP case by returning lcm(block_sizes) * dcp as scheduler_block_size
#       instead of raising ValueError.
#    Related PR (if no, explain why):
#       vLLM PR #40860 ([Feat] DeepSeek V4 Rebased).
#    Future Plan:
#       Remove this patch once upstream vLLM supports hybrid KV cache + CP for
#       non-CUDA backends, or exposes a platform hook for this behavior.
#
# ** 10. File: platform/patch_mamba_block_aligned_split.py**
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#   1. `vllm.v1.core.sched.scheduler.Scheduler._mamba_block_aligned_split`
#    Why:
#       On a PD decode consumer, a request with one prompt token remaining can
#       be padded to a `1 + K` speculative verifier window before Mamba
#       alignment runs. Splitting that window at the next block boundary makes
#       its physical width smaller than the advertised speculative placeholder
#       count.
#    How:
#       Return the complete requested width on KV consumers. Delegate producers
#       and non-PD deployments to the original upstream method unchanged.
#    Related issue:
#       https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/54392
#    Future Plan:
#       Remove this compatibility patch once upstream preserves speculative
#       window atomicity for PD-admitted requests.
#
# ** 10a. File: platform/patch_mamba_config.py**
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#   1. `vllm.model_executor.models.config.HybridAttentionMambaModelConfig.verify_and_update_config`
#    Why:
#       block size is set to 16 in vLLM which is not supported by Ascend.
#    How：
#       Set block size to 128 on npu.
#    Related PR (if no, explain why):
#       we'll fix this in vLLM soon.
#    Future Plan:
#       Remove this patch when vLLM merges the PR.
#
# ** 11. File: platform/patch_mamba_config_310.py**
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#   1. `vllm.model_executor.models.config.HybridAttentionMambaModelConfig.verify_and_update_config`
#    Why:
#       310P requires attention page size to be >= mamba page size and aligned to
#       the kernel block alignment (128). The upstream verify_and_update_config
#       default (block size 16) is not supported on 310P.
#    How：
#       On 310P, override verify_and_update_config to align mamba_block_size and
#       attention block size to the 128-token kernel alignment, ensuring the
#       attention page size is >= mamba page size. This is the 310P counterpart
#       of patch_mamba_config.py (selected by the active hardware profile).
#    Related PR (if no, explain why):
#       No, 310P-specific kernel alignment requirement.
#    Future Plan:
#       Remove this patch once upstream supports 310P-aligned mamba block sizing.
#
# ** 12. File: platform/patch_mamba_manager.py**
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#   1. `vllm.v1.core.single_type_kv_cache_manager.MambaManager`
#    Why:
#       1. Upstream hybrid prefix cache lookup does not support DCP.
#       2. Upstream MambaManager#get_num_blocks_to_allocate give the
#          wrong number of blocks when an external cache hit occurred
#    How:
#       1. Replace MambaManager with AscendMambaManager for prefix cache hit lookup
#          on hybrid Mamba paths (logical mamba block_size when caching is enabled).
#       2. Override the get_num_blocks_to_allocate method to fix the number of blocks
#          when hitting the external cache and loading synchronously
#    Related PR (if no, explain why):
#       1. https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/40996
#       2. https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/46892
#    Future Plan:
#       1. Remove this patch once the supported upstream revision includes
#          hybrid prefix cache lookup for DCP.
#       2. Remove this patch once upstream accept 46892 pr or fixed the bug by other pr.
#
# ** 13. File: platform/patch_minimax_m2_config.py**
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#   1. `vllm.config.model.ModelConfig._verify_quantization`
#    Why:
#       MiniMax-M2 fp8 checkpoints on NPU may fail upstream quantization validation.
#       vllm-ascend needs to disable fp8 quantization and load bf16 dequantized
#       weights in worker-side patches instead.
#    How：
#       Monkey-patch `_verify_quantization` and intercept platform quantization
#       verification to force `cfg.quantization=None` for MiniMax-M2 fp8 on NPU.
#    Related PR (if no, explain why):
#       No, upstream behavior differs across versions and needs discussion.
#    Future Plan:
#       Remove this patch once upstream supports MiniMax-M2 fp8 on NPU or provides
#       a backend-safe validation / override mechanism.
#
#   2. `vllm.config.model.ModelConfig._verify_cuda_graph`
#    Why:
#       For MiniMax-M2 on NPU with ACL graph capture enabled, HCCL op expansion
#       mode affects graph shape coverage. Users may forget to set it.
#    How：
#       If user doesn't set it, set `HCCL_OP_EXPANSION_MODE=AIV` for this model
#       and log a warning when a different value is detected.
#    Related PR (if no, explain why):
#       No, this is an environment-specific tuning knob.
#    Future Plan:
#       Remove this patch if upstream provides an official NPU graph-capture
#       guidance / auto-configuration path for HCCL.
#
#   3. `vllm.config.speculative.SpeculativeConfig._verify_args`
#    Why:
#       Upstream vLLM's eagle3/extract_hidden_states restricts target model types
#       via a whitelist. MiniMax-M2 should be allowed once the worker-side model
#       can emit auxiliary hidden states.
#    How：
#       Monkey-patch `_verify_args` to bypass only the whitelist ValueError for
#       MiniMax model_type when method is eagle3/extract_hidden_states.
#       SpeculativeConfig is a Pydantic dataclass (`@config`); init validation calls
#       `__pydantic_decorators__.model_validators["_verify_args"].func`, so that
#       `Decorator.func` must be replaced (not only `SpeculativeConfig._verify_args`),
#       then `rebuild_dataclass(SpeculativeConfig, force=True)`.
#       If `VllmConfig` was imported earlier, also `rebuild_dataclass(VllmConfig, ...)`
#       so nested `speculative_config` validation does not use a stale schema.
#    Related PR (if no, explain why):
#       https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/37512
#    Future Plan:
#       Remove this patch once upstream whitelist includes MiniMax.
#
#   4. `vllm.model_executor.models.registry` (spec decode aliases)
#    Why:
#       Some Eagle3 draft checkpoints may declare a MiniMax-specific architecture
#       string while reusing the shared Eagle3 implementation.
#    How：
#       Register `Eagle3MiniMaxM2ForCausalLM` as an alias pointing to the
#       existing Eagle3 implementation in the speculative decoding registry.
#    Related PR (if no, explain why):
#       https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/37512
#    Future Plan:
#       Drop the alias once upstream registry includes it or the checkpoint
#       standardizes architecture strings.
#
# ** 14. File: platform/patch_mla_prefill_backend.py**
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#   1. `vllm.v1.attention.backends.mla.common.get_mla_prefill_backend`
#    Why:
#       PR vllm-project/vllm#32623 introduced a new MLAPrefillBackend abstraction.
#       When MLAAttention.__init__ calls get_mla_prefill_backend(), the upstream
#       selector sees that Ascend NPU returns None for get_device_capability() and
#       falls back to FlashAttnPrefillBackend, which asserts flash_attn_varlen_func
#       is available — crashing on Ascend.
#    How：
#       Register a no-op AscendMLAPrefillBackend and patch get_mla_prefill_backend
#       so that MLAAttention.__init__ completes without error. Ascend's
#       AscendSFAImpl/AscendMLAImpl handles the full forward pass (including
#       prefill) via impl.forward(), so prefill_backend.run_prefill_* is never
#       called.
#    Related PR (if no, explain why):
#       https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/32623
#    Future Plan:
#       Remove this patch once upstream `get_mla_prefill_backend` provides a
#       platform/device hook so Ascend can be selected (or skipped) without
#       monkey-patching.
#
# ** 15. File: platform/patch_multiproc_executor.py**
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#   1. `vllm.v1.executor.multiproc_executor.MultiprocExecutor`
#    Why:
#       vLLM create child process with daemon=True, which doesn't work with EPLB case, since EPLB will create
#       a new process which is not allowed by daemon=True.
#    How：
#       Set daemon=False in MultiprocExecutor.
#    Related PR (if no, explain why):
#       Find a way to support daemon=False in vLLM
#    Future Plan:
#       Remove this patch when vLLM fix the issue.
#
# ** 16. File: platform/patch_pp_mtp.py**
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#   1. `vllm.v1.outputs.ModelRunnerOutput`
#    Why:
#       PP + MTP mixed deployment needs the model runner to return the draft
#       tokens produced for the same scheduler output. Upstream output objects
#       do not carry `spec_token_ids` on all supported vLLM revisions.
#    How：
#       Add a backward-compatible `spec_token_ids` field to `ModelRunnerOutput`
#       and `EMPTY_MODEL_RUNNER_OUTPUT` when the field is missing.
#    Related PR (if no, explain why):
#       Backport of local vLLM PP+MTP branch changes.
#    Future Plan:
#       Remove this patch once the supported vLLM version carries PP-safe
#       speculative token metadata in `ModelRunnerOutput`.
#
#   2. `vllm.v1.engine.core.EngineCore.post_step`
#    Why:
#       With PP batch queue, synchronous scheduling can schedule the next batch
#       before the previous model output is consumed. Calling `post_step` in that
#       window updates `request.spec_token_ids` from live request state that may
#       already belong to the newer schedule step.
#    How：
#       In PP + MTP + batch queue + sync scheduling, skip `post_step` after model
#       execution and let scheduler output processing perform the spec token
#       writeback from the corresponding `ModelRunnerOutput`.
#    Related PR (if no, explain why):
#       Backport of local vLLM PP+MTP branch changes.
#    Future Plan:
#       Remove this patch when upstream makes spec token writeback output-owned
#       for PP batch queue.
#
#   3. `vllm.v1.core.sched.scheduler.Scheduler._update_after_schedule`
#      `vllm.v1.core.sched.scheduler.Scheduler.update_from_output`
#    Why:
#       PP async scheduling must not schedule the same decode request again
#       before the previous output has written sampled/spec tokens back. Without
#       this request-level in-flight fence, the next step may use stale sampled
#       tokens and produce incorrect target-model output. Intermediate prefill
#       chunks do not depend on sampled/spec writeback and should remain
#       schedulable to keep the PP pipeline filled.
#    How：
#       After scheduling, set a temporary decode fence for final prefill/decode
#       chunks in PP IPC mode. Release the fence in `update_from_output` after
#       the matching output is processed. For PP + MTP, also filter zero-token
#       placeholder requests before delegating to upstream scheduler accounting,
#       then write `request.spec_token_ids` from `model_runner_output.spec_token_ids`.
#    Related PR (if no, explain why):
#       Backport of local vLLM PP+MTP branch changes.
#    Future Plan:
#       Remove this patch once upstream supports request-level PP async fences
#       and output-owned spec token writeback.
#
#   4. `vllm.v1.core.sched.scheduler.Scheduler._make_cached_request_data`
#    Why:
#       Upstream PP async scheduling relies on direct PP-rank GPU broadcast for
#       sampled-token handoff and omits `new_token_ids` from cached request data.
#       vLLM Ascend routes PP sampled-token handoff through scheduler IPC, so
#       non-last PP ranks need the previous sampled token in both sync and async
#       scheduling. This also avoids copying draft tokens as confirmed tokens in
#       PP + MTP mixed deployment.
#    How：
#       Temporarily build cached request data with sync-PP semantics in PP IPC
#       mode, then fill the last confirmed output token for requests whose
#       clamped upstream slice is empty.
#    Related PR (if no, explain why):
#       Backport of local vLLM PP+MTP branch changes.
#    Future Plan:
#       Remove this patch once upstream provides a scheduler-owned PP sampled
#       token handoff path that works for both sync and async scheduling.
#
#   5. `vllm.config.model.ModelConfig.verify_with_parallel_config`
#    Why:
#       Local Eagle/MTP drafters are loaded on the last PP stage rather than
#       partitioned across all PP ranks. Upstream `ModelConfig.verify_with_parallel_config`
#       validates against `pipeline_parallel_size`, which fails for these drafters
#       since they run locally with effective PP=1.
#    How：
#       Monkey-patch `verify_with_parallel_config` to detect Eagle/MTP drafter
#       models (by `model_type` and `architectures`) when `runner="draft"` and
#       `pipeline_parallel_size > 1`. For such configs, call the original verify
#       with a patched `pipeline_parallel_size=1` copy, preserving normal target-model
#       validation for non-drafter models.
#    Related PR (if no, explain why):
#       Backport of local vLLM PP+MTP branch changes.
#    Future Plan:
#       Remove this patch once upstream vLLM's `ModelConfig.verify_with_parallel_config`
#       supports local drafter models with PP > 1, or moves the PP validation to a
#       separate hook that can be overridden per-model-type.

# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#   1. `vllm.v1.engine.core.EngineCore.__init__`
#   2. `vllm.v1.engine.core.EngineCoreProc.run_engine_core`
#   3. `Scheduler.update_from_output` (scheduler class, wrapped when profiling chunk is enabled)
#    Why:
#       Profiling-based dynamic chunk sizing needs to run a one-shot profiling pass
#       after `model_executor` is ready, and to feed per-step execution latency back
#       into `ProfilingChunkManager` so the history-aware chunk predictor can refine
#       online. In multiprocessing `spawn` mode the child process starts a fresh
#       interpreter, so monkey-patches applied in the parent are lost unless the
#       subprocess entry point re-applies them before any `EngineCore` is created.
#    How：
#       Replace `EngineCore.__init__` to call `scheduler.run_profiling_chunk_init`
#       when present, then wrap `scheduler.update_from_output` once per process to
#       read `model_output.execution_time_ms` and `scheduler_output` token/chunk
#       metadata and call `ProfilingChunkManager.record_batch_execution_time` (and
#       bootstrap target latency for the first chunk when needed). Replace
#       `EngineCoreProc.run_engine_core` so importing this module in the child
#       re-runs the idempotent patch helper before delegating to the original
#       implementation.
#    Related PR (if no, explain why):
#       No, vllm-ascend-specific profiling / scheduling integration.
#    Future Plan:
#       Remove or narrow this patch if upstream exposes stable hooks for backend
#       profiling startup and per-step timing callbacks without monkey-patching
#       `EngineCore` and the multiprocess entry point.
#
# ** 18. File: platform/patch_speculative_config.py**
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#   1. `vllm.config.speculative.SpeculativeConfig.hf_config_override`
#    Why:
#       Several MTP draft models (DeepSeek-V3/V4, Pangu, MiMo, GLM4-MoE, ERNIE,
#       Nemotron-H, Qwen3-Next, Qwen3.5, Exaone, LongCat-Flash, Step3.5/3.7) are
#       loaded as the target model's MTP layer rather than a standalone model.
#       Upstream `SpeculativeConfig.hf_config_override` does not remap these
#       target model_types/architectures to their MTP variants, so spec decoding
#       cannot locate the drafter.
#    How：
#       Replace `SpeculativeConfig.hf_config_override` to detect the supported
#       target model_type/architecture, derive `n_predict` from
#       `num_nextn_predict_layers` (or `mtp_num_hidden_layers`), and rewrite
#       `model_type`/`architectures` to the corresponding MTP model. Also remaps
#       MistralLarge3 to its Eagle variant.
#    Related PR (if no, explain why):
#       No, vllm-ascend-specific MTP model type remapping.
#    Future Plan:
#       Remove this patch once upstream vLLM supports loading these MTP draft
#       models without a custom `hf_config_override`, or exposes a plugin hook
#       for MTP model_type/architecture remapping.

# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#   1. `vllm.sampling_params.SamplingParams._validate_structured_outputs`
#      `vllm.v1.structured_output.StructuredOutputManager.grammar_init`
#    Why:
#       V1 structured outputs use one engine-level backend, while `backend=auto`
#       resolves the backend per request. After one request initializes
#       `xgrammar`, a later request that resolves to `guidance` can still reach
#       the initialized `xgrammar` backend and crash during grammar compilation.
#    How:
#       Record the first resolved backend on the structured-output config and
#       reject later requests that resolve to a different backend. Also guard
#       `grammar_init` so requests that bypass API-side validation fail before
#       backend grammar compilation.

#       https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/43920
#       https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/44401
#    Future Plan:
#       Remove this patch once upstream vLLM either enforces backend consistency
#       before grammar compilation or safely handles mixed-backend grammar
#       failures without killing the engine.

#      `torch.accelerator.reset_peak_memory_stats`, `torch.accelerator.get_memory_info`,
#      `torch.accelerator.empty_cache`
#    Why:
#       Upstream vLLM (commit 747b068) replaced `current_platform.memory_stats()`
#       with `torch.accelerator.memory_stats()`, but `torch.accelerator` does not
#       route to the NPU backend, so memory APIs fail on Ascend. `empty_cache`
#       also needs an NPU-compatible no-op-friendly implementation.
#    How：
#       Monkey-patch `torch.accelerator` memory APIs to delegate to the
#       corresponding `torch.npu` implementations, and patch `empty_cache` to a
#       compatible wrapper.
#    Related PR (if no, explain why):
#       No, maps upstream torch.accelerator memory APIs to the NPU backend.

#      `vllm.entrypoints.openai.chat_completion.protocol.ChatCompletionStreamResponse`
#    Why:
#       vLLM v0.23.0 can serialize empty `tool_calls: []` fields for content-only
#       OpenAI chat responses / streaming deltas, while OpenAI-compatible SDKs
#       expect those empty fields to be omitted so clients see `tool_calls=None`.
#    How：
#       Wrap `model_dump` / `model_dump_json` for chat response payloads and drop
#       empty `tool_calls` lists from `message` / `delta` objects.

# ** 22. File: platform/patch_use_v2_model_runner.py**
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#   1. `vllm.config.vllm.VllmConfig.use_v2_model_runner`
#    Why:
#       Upstream vLLM enables the v2 model runner not only via the
#       VLLM_USE_V2_MODEL_RUNNER env var but also based on model
#       architecture whitelists, Triton availability, and feature
#       compatibility checks. On Ascend the NPU v2 runner is not yet
#       compatible with all upstream-defaulted models and features, so
#       enabling by model architecture can crash. We override the
#       property to read only VLLM_USE_V2_MODEL_RUNNER, deferring
#       model/framework checks to the NPU runner itself.
#    How:
#       Monkey-patch VllmConfig.use_v2_model_runner to return
#       envs.VLLM_USE_V2_MODEL_RUNNER (defaulting to False when unset).
#       worker/patch_v2/patch_use_v2_model_runner.py reuses this platform

# ** 2. File: worker/patch_deepseek_v2.py**
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#   1. `vllm.model_executor.models.deepseek_v2.DeepseekV2MLAAttention.__init__`
#    Why:
#       GLM-5.2 checkpoints omit `Indexer` weights on shared-indexer layers,
#       while GLM-5.1 IndexCache overrides only skip top-k computation and keep
#       per-layer `Indexer` weights. Treating both layouts alike breaks GLM-5.1
#       weight loading.
#    How:
#       Skip `Indexer` construction only when the layer both skips top-k and is
#       explicitly marked `shared` in `indexer_types`. MTP layers always retain
#       a complete `Indexer`.
#    Related PR (if no, explain why):
#       https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/45895
#    Future Plan:

# ** 4. File: worker/patch_eagle3_init.py**
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#   1. `vllm.model_executor.models.llama_eagle3.Eagle3LlamaForCausalLM`,
#      `vllm.model_executor.models.deepseek_v2.Eagle3DeepseekV2ForCausalLM` /
#      `Eagle3DeepseekV3ForCausalLM`
#    Why:
#       Upstream Eagle3 draft models compute `target_layer_num` via
#       `model_config.get_num_layers(parallel_config)` which, under PP, returns the
#       per-PP-stage count. This value feeds into the draft model's
#       `start_layer_id` (used to build parameter name prefixes like
#       `model.layers.<start_layer_id + i>`). With PP>1 the prefixes collide with
#       the checkpoint (e.g. a 61-layer target + 2-way PP builds prefixes 31..34
#       while the checkpoint expects 61..64), breaking weight loading. Additionally,
#       `config.target_layer_count` (used to index `layer_types` for draft
#       attention) ends up wrong.
#    How：
#       Patch the affected Eagle3 draft models to use
#       `get_total_num_hidden_layers()` instead, which matches the checkpoint's
#       global layer indices and keeps `target_layer_count` correct.
#    Related PR (if no, explain why):
#       No, vllm-ascend-specific Eagle3 + PP weight-loading fix.
#    Future Plan:
#       Remove this patch once upstream Eagle3 draft models compute
#       `target_layer_num` from the total (not per-stage) hidden layer count.
#
# ** 5. File: worker/patch_eagle3_pp_aux.py**
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#   1. Eagle3 target inner models (`DeepseekV2Model`, EagleModelMixin-based models)
#      `forward`, `make_empty_intermediate_tensors`
#    Why:
#       In Eagle3 speculative decoding with Pipeline Parallelism (PP), auxiliary
#       hidden states are collected from specific target model layers (e.g.,
#       layers 2, N/2, N-3). When these layers span multiple PP stages, the last
#       PP rank (where the drafter runs) only sees a subset of aux states, causing
#       `combine_hidden_states` to fail with a k-axis shape mismatch.
#    How：
#       Wrap the inner model's `forward` and `make_empty_intermediate_tensors` to
#       transparently pass aux hidden states through IntermediateTensors across PP
#       stages. Each PP stage carries forward all aux states from previous stages,
#       and the last PP rank merges them into a single list for the drafter.
#    Related PR (if no, explain why):
#       No, vllm-ascend-specific Eagle3 + PP aux-state propagation.
#    Future Plan:
#       Remove this patch once upstream Eagle3 supports collecting aux hidden
#       states that span PP stages without cross-stage propagation.
#
# ** 6. File: worker/patch_fused_moe.py**
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#   1. `vllm.model_executor.layers.fused_moe.FusedMoEFactory`
#    Why:
#       The worker process re-imports the MoE factory after the platform
#       patch has already redirected it to AscendMoERunner. Re-applying the
#       monkey-patch directly would wrap an already-patched factory.
#    How：
#       Reuse the platform patch (`platform/patch_fused_moe.py`) so the monkey
#       patch lives in a single module and is applied idempotently during worker
#       initialization.
#    Related PR (if no, explain why):
#       No, see platform/patch_fused_moe.py.
#    Future Plan:
#       Remove this module together with platform/patch_fused_moe.py once upstream
#       exposes a backend dispatch / plugin hook for selecting the MoE runner.
#
# ** 7. File: worker/patch_idex_310.py**

#      `vllm.model_executor.layers.fla.ops.index.prepare_chunk_offsets`
#    Why:
#       310P uses Ascend-friendly chunk index helpers for Qwen GDN prefill.
#    How:
#       Replace upstream FLA chunk index helper functions with 310P implementations.
#
#   2. `vllm_ascend.spec_decode.llm_base_proposer.AscendSpecDecodeBaseProposer.set_inputs_first_pass`
#    Why:
#       310P needs to protect the tail slot during MTP input_ids shift to avoid
#       GatherV2 corruption from persistent drafter input buffers.
#    How:
#       Reuse the 310P proposer implementation for the first-pass input shift.
#
#   3. `vllm.model_executor.layers.mamba.gdn.qwen_gdn_linear_attn.QwenGatedDeltaNetAttention`
#    Why:
#       Qwen GDN needs 310P-specific state helpers, forward core, state dtype,
#       and attention backend/builder wiring.
#    How:
#       Patch Qwen GDN methods to use Ascend GDN implementations and the 310P
#       GDN attention backend. RC devices also route upstream GDNAttentionBackend
#       to the 310P metadata builder.
#
#   4. `vllm.model_executor.models.qwen3_vl.Qwen3_VisionTransformer.rot_pos_emb`
#      (RC only)
#    Why:
#       310P images do not install Triton, so upstream ``HAS_TRITON=False``
#       already selects ``pos_embed_interpolate_native``; no pos-embed rewrite.
#       RC still needs blocking H2D in `rot_pos_emb` to avoid indexing races.
#    How:
#       On RC only, bind `rot_pos_emb_310` from
#       `vllm_ascend/_310p/ops/qwen3vl_310.py`.
#    Related PR (if no, explain why):
#       No, 310P custom operator and backend behavior are vllm-ascend specific.
#    Future Plan:
#       Remove this patch when upstream exposes stable hooks for 310P GDN
#       chunk metadata, spec-decode input layout, backend selection, and
#       vision rot_pos_emb that does not race on 310P RC.

#   1. `vllm.model_executor.models.kimi_k25_vit.Learnable2DInterpPosEmbDivided_fixed.forward`
#    Why:
#       The forward method uses interpolate with ops not supported on NPU.
#    How：
#       Replace with a new forward that uses CPU for interpolate when shape mismatch,
#       and use get_rope_shape to handle the rope shape interpolation.
#    Future Plan:
#       Remove this patch when vLLM aligns with the latest main.

# ** 9. File: worker/patch_mamba_utils.py**
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#   1. `vllm.v1.worker.mamba_utils.batch_memcpy_kernel = batch_memcpy_kernel`
#    Why:
#       Oringnal batch_memcpy_kernel implemented in vLLM might encounter bugs when running on
#       Ascend hardwares.
#    How：
#       patch to fix related bugs.
#    Future Plan:
#       Remove this patch when:
#       (1) oringnal batch_memcpy_kernel can run on Ascend hardware.
#       or
#       (2) design a dispatch mechanism for batch_memcpy_kernel.
#   2. `vllm.v1.worker.mamba_utils.batch_memcpy = batch_memcpy`
#    Why:
#       vLLM use BLOCK_SIZE 1024 for batch_memcpy_kernel. This results in suboptimal performance
#       on Ascend hardwares.
#    How：
#       patch to change BLOCK_SIZE to 8192.
#    Future Plan:
#       Remove this patch when:
#       design a dispatch mechanism for batch_memcpy_kernel.
#   3. `mamba_utils.preprocess_mamba = preprocess_mamba`
#    Why:
#       1. preprocess_mamba has a assert logic, cause kv transfer call fails
#       2. preprocess_mamba copy the state of previous step to the last block before kv transfer load
#    How:
#       1. patch to remove assert
#       2. patch to collect per-layer copy metadata in preprocess_mamba. With
#          layerwise KV transfer, copy each layer's state only after that
#          layer finishes loading; otherwise keep the original batched copy.
#    Future Plan:
#       Remove this patch when:
#       vLLM itself supports kv transfer for mamba
#
# ** 10. File: worker/patch_minimax_m2.py**
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#   1. `vllm.model_executor.models.minimax_m2.MiniMaxM2MoE.forward`
#    Why:
#       In TP mode, MiniMax-M2 MoE needs a backend-aware reduction path to avoid
#       unnecessary communication / maintain correctness on NPU.
#    How：
#       Replace the forward to call `experts.maybe_all_reduce_tensor_model_parallel`
#       when `tp_size > 1`.
#    Related PR (if no, explain why):
#       No, model-specific behavior.
#    Future Plan:
#       Move this behavior upstream once a generic MoE reduce hook exists.
#
#   2. `vllm.model_executor.models.minimax_m2.MiniMaxM2Attention.forward`
#    Why:
#       MiniMax-M2 attention benefits from the NPU fused split-qkv + RMSNorm + rope
#       kernel path.
#    How：
#       Replace `forward` to call `torch.ops.vllm.split_qkv_tp_rmsnorm_rope` before
#       the upstream attention and output projection steps.
#    Related PR (if no, explain why):
#       No, backend-specific fused kernel path.
#    Future Plan:
#       Remove this patch when upstream exposes a backend dispatch path for this
#       fused attention preparation.
#
#   3. `vllm.model_executor.models.minimax_m2.MiniMaxM2Model.load_weights`
#    Why:
#       MiniMax-M2 fp8 checkpoints may store fp8 weights with per-block inverse
#       scales. On NPU we load bf16 weights by dequantizing at load time.
#    How：
#       Inject fp8 dequant helpers and wrap `load_weights` to convert fp8 weight +
#       `weight_scale_inv` pairs into bf16 blocks before delegating to upstream.
#    Related PR (if no, explain why):
#       No, fp8 load format and backend constraints are model/backend specific.
#    Future Plan:
#       Remove this patch when upstream supports MiniMax-M2 fp8 loading on NPU.

# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#   1. `vllm.model_executor.models.qwen3_5.Qwen3_5GatedDeltaNet._forward_core`
#    Why:
#       The class Qwen3_5GatedDeltaNet reuse the `_forward_core` method of Qwen3NextGatedDeltaNet,
#       but the ascendC ops of Qwen3NextGatedDeltaNet do not support ssm_state with float32 format.
#    How：
#       patch Qwen3_5GatedDeltaNet._forward_core to use triton ops like `fused_recurrent_gated_delta_rule`.
#    Future Plan:

#    Why:
#       The function directly calls the ops.rms_norm and ops.rotary_imbedding operators,

#      `vllm.model_executor.models.qwen3_vl_moe.Qwen3MoeLLMForCausalLM.end_layer`
#    Why:
#       Qwen3-VL-MoE checks the language-model pipeline boundary on non-first
#       PP ranks, but Qwen3MoeLLMForCausalLM keeps start_layer/end_layer only
#       on the inner model object.
#    How:
#       Expose start_layer/end_layer properties on Qwen3MoeLLMForCausalLM and
#       forward them to the inner model.
#    Future Plan:

# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#   1. `vllm.model_executor.layers.fused_moe.routed_experts_capturer.RoutedExpertsCapturer.capture`
#    Why:
#       The upstream implementation doesn't support vllm-ascend specific MoE communication types
#       (ALLTOALL and MC2). In the SP + modular-kernel path, the original code cannot correctly
#       handle tensor splitting and all-gather operations on NPU, especially when tokens are
#       unevenly distributed across TP ranks or padded to max_tokens in MC2 mode.
#    How：
#       Override the capture method to add support for vllm-ascend's MoECommType:
#         - Check `_EXTRA_CTX.moe_comm_type` to determine if ALLTOALL or MC2 mode is active
#         - Calculate correct gather_topk_ids_shape based on communication type:
#           * ALLTOALL: uses actual token_num_per_dp for shape calculation
#           * MC2: uses padded max_tokens * tp_size for shape calculation
#         - Properly handle tensor_split and all_gather operations for NPU distributed communication
#    Future Plan:
#       Remove this patch when upstream vLLM supports MoE communication type abstraction that
#       can be extended by hardware plugins like vllm-ascend.

# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#   1. `vllm.model_executor.models.step3p5.Step3p5Attention.forward`
#    Why:
#       Add split_qkv_rmsnorm_rope support for step3.5/3.7. This model can't use
#       fusion pass to enable this op because of 2 reasons: 1) Step uses
#       Gemmanorm instead of normal norm, so existing fusion pass can't be
#       matched. 2) Step has 2 kinds of attention layer (full attention and
#       sliding window attention), each has different number of q_head. Right
#       now, torch.compile will use same pattern to match different attention
#       layer so there will be shape mismatch in split op.
#    How:
#       Monkey-patch Step3p5Attention.forward to enable split_qkv_rmsnorm_rope.
#    Future Plan:
#       Remove this patch once torch.compile fully supports matching pattern from
#       op's params.

#      `vllm.v1.worker.gpu.sample.gumbel.gumbel_sample`
#    Why:
#       triton ops in vLLM perform not good on NPU. And there is no dispatch mechanism for triton ops.
#    How：
#       override triton ops in vLLM with ascend implementation
#    Related PR (if no, explain why):

#    Future Plan:
#       Remove this patch when vLLM support the dispatch function.
#
#   2. `triton.next_power_of_2`
#    Why:
#       The Triton version bundled with torch_npu on Ascend NPU
#       does not include `next_power_of_2`, which is called by
#       upstream vLLM and vLLM-Ascend code in 94+ places.
#       Additionally, when Triton is not available (HAS_TRITON=False),
#       vLLM uses TritonPlaceholder which also lacks this function.
#    How：
#       Import `triton` from vllm.triton_utils (which handles both
#       real Triton and TritonPlaceholder) and inject `next_power_of_2`
#       onto the module, reusing `vllm.utils.math_utils.next_power_of_2`.
#    Related PR (if no, explain why):

#
#   3. `vllm.third_party.flash_linear_attention.ops.kda`
#    Why:
#       GLM-5.3-Flash and Kimi KDA layers import `fused_recurrent_kda` /
#       `chunk_kda_with_fused_gate` from upstream FLA. Those kernels are CUDA
#       Triton; Ascend already has NPU Triton equivalents under
#       `vllm_ascend.ops.triton.kda`.
#    How：
#       Rebind the FLA kda entry points to the NPU implementations before the
#       model is constructed. The NPU wrappers expand GLM's bounded (safe)
#       gate and beta sigmoid in Python because the NPU recurrent kernel does
#       not fuse `COMPUTE_GATE` / `SIGMOID_BETA`.

# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#   1. `vllm.v1.worker.gpu.attn_utils.get_kv_cache_spec`
#    Why:
#       The current v2 worker still goes through the shared upstream v1 helper
#       to build KV cache specs. For Ascend MLA layers that helper returns the
#       generic `MLAAttentionSpec`, but NPU-side cache allocation and reshape
#       logic expects `AscendMLAAttentionSpec`.
#    How：
#       Monkey-patch `get_kv_cache_spec` so regular attention layers keep the
#       upstream behavior while MLA layers are rewritten to
#       `AscendMLAAttentionSpec`, including the FA-quant head-size adjustment.
#    Related PR (if no, explain why):
#       No. This is a plugin-side compatibility patch for the current upstream

#       construction or v2 worker no longer depends on the shared v1 helper.
#
#   2. `DeepseekV32IndexerCache.get_attn_backend`
#    Why:
#       SFA indexer cache layers require the Ascend cache-only backend;

#       vllm use InputBatch to make dummy tensors. in `model_runner.py` and `cudagraph_utils.py`
#       which make it difficult to inherit from vllm methods.
#    How：

#   1. PPHandler sampled-token broadcast methods
#    Why:
#       Target-driven speculative decoding generates next-step draft tokens
#       after target sampling. Non-last PP ranks need both results for the same
#       delayed request-state update.
#    How:
#       Defer the target-token broadcast until drafting finishes, then carry
#       accepted target tokens and next-step draft tokens in the same V2 PP
#       queue slot.
#    Related PR (if no, explain why):

#    Why:
#       triton ops in vLLM perform not good on NPU. And there is no dispatch mechanism for triton ops.
#       apply_penalties also fails on large input shape because of the triton kernel limitation.
#    How：

#
#   2. `vllm.v1.worker.gpu.metrics.logits.libdevice`
#    Why:
#       The upstream `get_num_nans` Triton kernel imports its libdevice
#       functions from the default CUDA-oriented module. On Ascend, this makes
#       Triton resolve CUDA libdevice symbols instead of the CANN equivalents,
#       causing the kernel compilation to fail.
#    How:
#       Rebind `metrics.logits.libdevice` to
#       `triton.language.extra.cann.libdevice`. Existing references to
#       `get_num_nans` in the sampler and rejection sampler then use the CANN
#       libdevice when the kernel is compiled.
#    Related PR (if no, explain why):
#       No. This is a Triton-Ascend backend compatibility patch for the

#       also import this compatibility module. The actual monkey-patch is defined
#       in `platform/patch_use_v2_model_runner.py`.

#   1. `vllm.v1.worker.gpu.states.UvaBuffer`
#    Why:
#       ASCEND NPUs do not support UVA yet, so we need to wrap it in vLLM.
#    How：
#       make UvaBuffer a dummy class, mimic the interface of vllm UvaBuffer.

#      `vllm.v1.worker.gpu.spec_decode.dspark.speculator.load_dspark_model`
#    Why:
#       Same-checkpoint DSpark drafts (e.g. DeepSeek-V4 MTP, weights under
#       `mtp.*`) reuse the target weights and declare no quantization of their
#       own, but upstream `load_dspark_model` derives the draft quant config via
#       `get_draft_quant_config`, which returns None for them. That builds an
#       unquantized draft, and a W4A8/W8A8 target checkpoint cannot be loaded
#       into it (the draft linear layers lack the `weight_offset`/
#       `weight_scale`/`scale_bias` params the checkpoint ships), failing with
#       a KeyError.
#    How：
#       For same-checkpoint drafts (`draft_model_config.model ==
#       model_config.model`), temporarily redirect `get_draft_quant_config` to
#       the target quant config during `load_dspark_model`, then restore it.
#       Self-contained drafts (e.g. Qwen3 DSpark speculators) keep their own
#       quant config.
#    Future Plan:
#       Remove this patch once upstream `load_dspark_model` inherits the target
#       quant config for same-checkpoint drafts.
#
# ** 34. File: platform/patch_vision.py**
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#   1. `vllm.model_executor.models.vision.FusedInputNorm.forward`
#    Why:
#       Upstream vLLM uses PyTorch 2.13.0, which requires eps > 0 for training
#       but allows eps >= 0 for inference. vllm-ascend bundles PyTorch 2.10.0,
#       which does not distinguish scenarios and requires eps > 0 in all cases.
#       So when upstream FusedInputNorm passes eps=0.0 to F.batch_norm it works
#       fine upstream, but fails on vllm-ascend with "batch_norm eps must be
#       positive".
#    How：
#       Monkey-patch FusedInputNorm.forward to use eps=1e-5 instead of 0.0.
#       The patch is guarded with contextlib.suppress(ImportError) so it does
#       not crash on release wheels (v0.26.0) where FusedInputNorm does not exist.
#       Upstream PR #51734 (dc5101fb1b, Aug 10) rewrote FusedInputNorm.forward to
#       use a broadcast multiply-add (x * weight + bias) instead of F.batch_norm,
#       removing running_mean/running_var. That commit is included in the target
#       16cfe728, so the patch is gated to v0.27.1 only via vllm_version_is;
#       on newer versions FusedInputNorm.forward is used as-is (multiply-add).

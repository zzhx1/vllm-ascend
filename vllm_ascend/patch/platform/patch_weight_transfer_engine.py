# Patch target: vllm.distributed.weight_transfer.factory.WeightTransferEngineFactory
#
# Replace the "nccl" factory entry with HCCLWeightTransferEngine so that
# --weight-transfer-config '{"backend": "nccl"}' loads the HCCL engine
# instead of the (unavailable) NCCL engine on Ascend NPU.
#
# Why this approach (factory swap) instead of patching Literal["nccl", "ipc"]:
#   WeightTransferConfig.backend is a pydantic Literal["nccl", "ipc"].
#   Adding "hccl" would require modifying pydantic core schemas — fragile
#   across pydantic versions.  Swapping the factory entry means users pass
#   the already-accepted "nccl" string, but the factory resolves it to HCCL.
#
# Timing — guaranteed to run before first factory usage:
#
#   vllm serve main()
#     line 24: from vllm.entrypoints.utils import ...
#       → vllm.platforms.__getattr__("current_platform")
#       → resolve_current_platform_cls_qualname()
#       → vllm_ascend:register() → NPUPlatform()
#       → NPUPlatform.pre_register_and_update()
#       → adapt_patch(is_global_patch=True)
#       → imports vllm_ascend.patch.platform
#       → THIS PATCH RUNS  ← "nccl" now points to HCCLWeightTransferEngine
#     ...
#     lines 82-86: subparser_init() → make_arg_parser()
#     line 87: parse_args() → validates backend="nccl" via Literal (passes)
#     ...
#     later: worker init → WeightTransferEngineFactory.create_engine(config)
#       → config.backend == "nccl" → factory loads HCCLWeightTransferEngine
#
# Future Plan:
#   Remove this patch when upstream vllm relaxes the Literal type to str
#   or provides an extension point for out-of-tree backends.

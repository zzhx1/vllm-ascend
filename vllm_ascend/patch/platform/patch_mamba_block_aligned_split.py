"""Apply Ascend-specific Mamba chunk-boundary handling.

A newly admitted KV-consumer request can have one prompt token left after the
external cache hit. The waiting scheduler pads that token to a ``1 + K``
speculative verifier window before Mamba alignment is applied. If the window
starts mid-block, the alignment split can shorten its physical width while the
request still advertises all ``K`` speculative placeholders.

Decode consumers preserve the complete verifier window. Sparse index-kpool
producers align against the resolved common cache-group boundary because their
physical indexer-state block is smaller than the Mamba checkpoint interval.
Other models retain the upstream behavior.

On a pure PD prefill producer or a standalone instance the EAGLE one-block
backoff of the last cacheable position is suppressed: matched content-hash
blocks are always verified prompt blocks there, while the backoff would leave
the final full mamba-align state page unmaterialized across the chunk boundary
(copy-on-write in MambaManager.allocate_new_blocks), pinning hybrid prefix
hits one full page (or entirely) short.

    """Preserve PD windows and align sparse index-kpool cache groups.

    On a pure PD prefill producer or a standalone instance the EAGLE
    one-block backoff of the last cacheable position is suppressed.
    ``Scheduler._mamba_block_aligned_split`` backs the last cacheable
    mamba-align page off by one block (and, on newer vLLM revisions, shifts
    the partial-tail checkpoint boundary) whenever the EAGLE block drop is
    active. Consequently a producer prefill can never end a chunk at its
    final full-page boundary. In mamba "align" mode the recurrent state of a
    page is only materialized across a chunk boundary (copy-on-write in
    ``MambaManager.allocate_new_blocks``), so the suppressed split leaves the
    final full state page unhashed. Hybrid coordinator hits reconcile to the
    per-group minimum: even with the full-attention group fixed by the
    coordinator exemption, the mamba groups report one full page less
    (1600-token prompts -> 0 hit, 3200-token prompts -> 1536 with 1536-token
    align pages) - the observed MTP prefix-cache kill band.

    Rather than copy the scheduler method (its body moves between vLLM
    revisions), invoke the original with the drop bit temporarily cleared:
    every read of the bit inside the method exists solely to compensate for
    the block drop, and on the producer matched blocks are always verified
    prompt blocks and the coordinator never drops. Scheduling is
    single-threaded per scheduler instance, so the temporary toggle is safe.
    vLLM 0.28.x names the bit ``use_eagle``; newer revisions expose the
    dedicated ``use_eagle_block_drop`` knob.

    The suppression self-gates at call time on
    ``self.vllm_config.kv_transfer_config`` via ``_skips_eagle_block_drop``
    (the same PD role source used by the coordinator and the neighboring
    mamba split logic), so consumers and ``kv_both`` instances pass straight
    through with upstream behavior. Standalone instances (no connector)
    suppress the backoff too: the coordinator never drops there, so backing
    the split off would only erase cacheable hit length.

# AscendMTPSpeculator is a sibling of AscendEagleSpeculator: both inherit the
# shared flat NPU draft loop from AscendAutoRegressiveSpeculator and layer it on
# their own upstream base (MTPSpeculator vs EagleSpeculator). MTP's draft uses
# MLA attention, so it overrides only the MLA-specific piece -- forwarding
# rotary positions into build_attn_metadata -- and leaves the flat loop
# inherited unchanged. Eager only: no graph-mode adaptations.

    The flat draft-metadata path (upstream ``_build_draft_attn_metadata``) calls

    *inside* ``build_decode_metadata`` for rotary cos/sin. This caches the
    current ``build_attn_metadata``, replaces it for the duration of the block
    with one that forwards ``positions[:pad]``, and restores it on exit -- so
    MTP can reuse the flat ``super()._build_draft_attn_metadata()`` path instead
    of duplicating the ``build_attn_metadata`` call and all its arguments.

    Must run inside ``build_attn_metadata_wrapper()``, which has already
    replaced the module-level ``build_attn_metadata`` with the Ascend builder.

class ACLGraphWrapper:
    """Wraps a runnable to add acl graph capturing and replaying ability. And
    provide attribute access to the underlying `runnable` via `__getattr__`.

    The workflow of this wrapper in the aclgraph dispatching is as follows:
    1. At initialization, a runtime mode is assigned to the wrapper (FULL or
    PIECEWISE).
    2. At runtime, the wrapper receives a runtime_mode and a
    batch_descriptor(key) from the forward context and blindly trust them
    for aclgraph dispatching.
    3. If runtime_mode is NONE or runtime_mode does not match the mode of the
    wrapper, just call the runnable directly.
    4. Otherwise, i.e., the runtime_mode matches the mode of the wrapper,
    the wrapper will perform aclgraph capture(if key does not exist, create
    a new entry and cache it) or replay (if key exists in the cache).

    Note: ACLGraphWrapper does not store persistent buffers or copy any
    runtime inputs into that buffers for replay. We assume implementing them
    is done outside of the wrapper. That is because we do not make any
    assumption on the dynamic shape (batch size) of the runtime inputs, as a
    trade-off for staying orthogonal to compilation logic. Nevertheless,
    tracing and checking the input addresses to be consistent during replay is
    guaranteed when VLLM_LOGGING_LEVEL == "DEBUG".

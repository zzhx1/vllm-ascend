    launch: the transfer is serialized against compute instead of overlapping
    it, which is the opposite of what layerwise exists to do. Measured on the
    prefill node this pinned ~26 ms per layer (~1.2 s per 44-layer step).

    Bounding the backlog instead lets the send thread work on layer L-N -- whose
    ``sync_save_events`` have long since completed -- while the compute stream is
    already several layers ahead. Ordering is unaffected because the thread still
    consumes the queue strictly in submission order, and only one ranged put is
    ever in flight. Complete publication is still guaranteed: ``save_kv_layer``
    waits for the final layer's save event at the end of every step, which
    implies every earlier layer has committed.

    Eight layers of slack preserved the measured overlap without introducing a
    public tuning surface. Full drains are still enforced on teardown.

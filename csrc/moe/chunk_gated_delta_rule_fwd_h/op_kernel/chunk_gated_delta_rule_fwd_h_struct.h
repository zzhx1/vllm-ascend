 * \file chunk_gated_delta_rule_fwd_h_struct.h
 * \brief Plain tiling data struct for chunk_gated_delta_rule_fwd_h.
 *
 * The aclnn/ascendc framework auto-generates a kernel-side tiling struct named
 * ChunkGatedDeltaRuleFwdHTilingData (global scope) from the BEGIN_TILING_DATA_DEF
 * macro in chunk_gated_delta_rule_fwd_h_tiling.h. The fast kernel launch extension
 * compiles the kernel standalone (without that auto-generated header), so it provides
 * the same plain struct here. The field order/types mirror the macro definition so the
 * kernel/scheduler can read it the same way, and so the struct can be passed by value
 * to the kernel via the <<<>>> launch (its address is a valid GM_ADDR on Atlas A2).

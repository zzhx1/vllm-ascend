# Persistent Incremental Csrc Build Cache

## Overview

vLLM Ascend builds native third-party libraries and many AscendC custom
operators. An exact final-artifact cache is fast when it matches, but any
source change invalidates the complete artifact. The persistent incremental
csrc cache adds a second level that reuses individual compiler actions across
CI jobs, workspaces, and repeated local source builds.

The two cache levels have different roles:

```text
L0 exact final artifact
        |
        | miss
        v
L1 persistent action entries
        |
        v
ordinary source build
```

The source build remains authoritative. L1 only replaces an equivalent action
with previously verified artifacts.

## Goals and non-goals

Goals:

- reuse native build work across CI jobs;
- reuse native build work across repeated local source builds without remote
  transport;
- invalidate only actions whose semantic inputs changed;
- reuse entries across equivalent checkout and build roots;
- persist local entries through the repository's cache transport;
- publish artifacts safely under concurrent builds; and
- degrade to an ordinary build when an optional cache layer is unavailable.

Non-goals:

- replacing compiler dependency tracking;
- replacing the L0 final-artifact cache;
- sharing file locks across physical nodes;
- requiring historical source snapshots to contain the cache engine; or
- migrating older cache schemas in place.

## Architecture

```text
workflow
  |
  +-- restore L1 snapshot
  |
  +-- CMake adapter
  |     |
  |     +-- action identity
  |     +-- entry lookup/validation
  |     +-- restore or compile
  |     +-- local entry save
  |     `-- custom-operator publication
  |
  `-- publish changed L1 snapshot (writers only)
```

`build_cache.py` owns local action identity, entries, locking, restoration,
and publication. CMake declares semantic inputs and invokes the engine.
Composite actions own persistent snapshot keys and OBS transport. Workflows
only decide where to restore and which trusted build roles may publish.

The two levels have separate correctness boundaries. L0 is the outer exact
final-artifact snapshot: a hit can skip the native build only when its full
artifact key matches. L1 is an outer persistent snapshot of the local action
cache. Restoring an L1 snapshot only makes candidate entries available; the
inner engine still validates each manifest, action key, schema, artifact model,
and artifact contents before accepting an entry. An L1 hit therefore never
overrides inner correctness, and an L1 miss never changes the correctness of a
normal source build.

The existing image-build L0 key uses architecture, base-image tag, and the
tracked csrc hash. Because an L0 hit skips compilation and therefore skips L1
entry validation, that key assumes a fixed compiler-image registry and
immutable tags. Changing the registry or republishing a tag with different
contents requires a new L0 key namespace or the full image identity in the
key; an L1 identity check cannot make an already accepted L0 artifact safe.
This PR does not change image-build L0 behavior or add L1 to Docker builds.

## Build flow

### Cold build

```text
L0 miss
  -> L1 miss
  -> normal source build starts
  -> action MISS
  -> compiler runs
  -> verified local entry save
  -> .updated marker
  -> writer publishes L1
  -> optional L0 publication
```

### Warm build

```text
L0 miss
  -> compatible L1 snapshot restored
  -> .updated marker reset
  -> normal source build starts
  -> action identity calculated
  -> entry validated
  -> action HIT
  -> artifacts restored
  -> compiler action skipped
```

An all-HIT build does not recreate `.updated`, so it does not publish another
unique remote snapshot.

## Cache identity

Each action key is the canonical hash of three independent identities:

```text
prepared_input_hash
    what is compiled

recipe_hash
    how it is compiled

compiler_environment_hash
    which toolchain compiles it
```

For custom operators, `operator_text_hash` provides the operator namespace. It
does not replace any of the three action-key components.

The entry manifest stores the hashes and the exact artifact model used by the
key. A HIT requires the expected schema, domain, action key, artifact model,
and verified artifact content.

## Prepared-input contract

Prepared inputs include all compiler-visible semantic content, including:

- generated operator sources;
- dependent generated sources;
- shared kernel sources;
- compiler-visible recipe files; and
- shared compatibility headers such as `cann_compat.h`.

Physical checkout and build roots are not semantic identity. UTF-8 text may
therefore normalize explicitly declared roots. A root may be normalized only
when every semantic object referenced through it is independently covered by
the action identity.

For example, a generated adapter can contain:

```text
-include /temporary/root/csrc/common/include/cann_compat.h
```

The temporary root is normalized, while `cann_compat.h` content is hashed as a
prepared input. Moving the workspace remains a HIT; changing the header is a
MISS.

The normalization contract is deliberately narrow:

- UTF-8 text replaces only explicit normalize roots at path-component
  boundaries;
- unrelated backslashes in source code, escapes, and regular expressions remain
  byte-sensitive;
- binary inputs remain raw-byte-sensitive;
- paths outside explicit roots remain sensitive; and
- symlink identity and resolved semantic content both participate in hashing.

An unreadable explicit semantic input is never silently omitted from identity.

## Recipe and compiler environment

The recipe identity covers compiler commands, recipe files, and explicit
recipe values after the same root normalization contract. `--set-env` compiler
overrides also participate, using their exact values: an override may point to
an input not otherwise covered by the prepared-input identity.

The compiler-environment identity covers the host platform, selected compiler
profile, tool version output, CANN metadata, and explicit environment values.
Absolute compiler installation paths are not semantic when the reported tool
identity is equal.

### CMake integration contract

`vllm_ascend_build_cache_command()` is a correctness-sensitive boundary, not
only a command wrapper. A caller that changes a compiler-visible input must
update the matching identity group in the same change:

- `PREPARED_INPUT` describes source, generated, dependent, and shared content;
- `RECIPE_FILE` and `RECIPE_VALUE` describe how that content is built;
- `SET_ENV` changes the compiler process environment and must remain in recipe
  identity whenever its value can affect the output;
- `ENVIRONMENT_FILE`, `ENVIRONMENT_VALUE`, and `ENVIRONMENT_TOOL` describe the
  compiler/toolkit environment; and
- `NORMALIZE_PATH` removes only a physical location whose referenced semantic
  content is already covered by one of those identity groups.

Removing or omitting an identity argument can cause a false HIT. Adding a
non-semantic physical path can cause avoidable cross-workspace misses. Changes
to the custom-operator generation inputs or the protobuf
`ExternalProject_Add()` command therefore require a cache-identity review.

## Schema and snapshot compatibility

Entry manifests use `SCHEMA_VERSION = 4`. Schema 4 introduced safe textual
prepared-input normalization and complete semantic coverage for normalized
paths. Older entries naturally miss because the persistent key contains the
schema and entry validation rejects a different schema. There is no in-place
migration: the first schema-4 build is cold and later builds are warm.

Schema 4 is the first production namespace for this cache. Pre-release local or
validation snapshots written by earlier schema-4 candidates are not production
compatible and must remain isolated from the production namespace. Any future
change that can map an old semantic input to a different meaning requires a
schema or identity revision rather than reusing those entries.

`PUBLISH_STATE_SCHEMA` is separate because build-tree artifact ownership is a
different format from persistent entry identity.

The snapshot key command has one compatibility model:

```text
schema
+ architecture
+ canonical SOC
+ explicit compiler-image identity for a nested container build
  or CANN metadata + runtime OS/libc identity for a direct build
```

The restore action adds the tracked csrc hash and a unique publication suffix.
Both producer and consumer keys therefore come from the same implementation.
An explicit compiler image takes precedence over the outer runner environment,
so a Docker build is keyed by the environment that actually compiles csrc.
Direct builds include the runtime OS/libc identity to keep host-built artifacts
from crossing incompatible system-header or ABI boundaries.

### Prepare, restore, and save actions

`prepare_csrc_l1_restore.py` is the shared key-preparation helper. It checks
that the tested source root contains the cache engine, derives the tracked csrc
hash when the caller did not provide one, computes the snapshot key, and exports
the cache directory and event-log paths. Unsupported or unidentifiable source
snapshots return `supported=false` so the caller can continue with a normal
build.

`.github/actions/csrc-l1-restore/action.yaml` invokes the helper, restores the
keyed outer snapshot with compatibility prefixes, and removes `.updated` before
the build. `.github/actions/csrc-l1-save/action.yaml` publishes only when the
caller supplies a primary key, the local cache contains `.updated`, and trusted
writer credentials are present. The local engine creates `.updated` only after
an entry is newly saved or replaced; an all-hit build consequently does not
republish an unchanged snapshot. Restore and save transport failures are
availability failures and remain fail-open. A missing or unparsable manifest,
or a manifest object that fails schema or artifact validation, is a MISS and is
rebuilt. Conflicts that could corrupt shared artifact publication or
synchronization fail the build. A JSON manifest with a non-object top level
currently raises during validation; it is not covered by the MISS fallback.

Workflow code and tested source are intentionally separate. Persistent action
references use `uses: $/.github/actions/csrc-l1-restore` and
`uses: $/.github/actions/csrc-l1-save`, where `$/.github` resolves the action
implementation from the workflow revision. The caller's repository and
`source_ref` may therefore be a fork or historical snapshot without selecting
an incompatible action implementation. Caller inputs still describe the
tested checkout: `source-root`, cache directory, architecture, SOC, toolchain
image, and optional csrc hash.

## Entry and artifact lifecycle

For each action the engine:

1. hashes prepared inputs, recipe, and compiler environment;
2. derives the content-addressed entry path;
3. acquires the entry and action locks;
4. validates and restores a matching entry;
5. otherwise runs the original build command;
6. discovers and verifies produced artifacts;
7. atomically saves the local entry;
8. marks the local L1 snapshot as updated; and
9. publishes custom-operator artifacts into the shared build output.

The entry manifest is the correctness record. No separate mutable index is
required for lookup or invalidation.

## Concurrency model

Three lock scopes protect distinct invariants:

- the entry lock permits one creator for a content-addressed entry;
- the action lock protects one action's private staging directory; and
- the publish lock serializes shared custom-operator output publication.

Custom operators compile into private staging directories. Publication tracks
artifact ownership and uses atomic replacement, preventing partial output from
becoming visible. A conflicting owner for the same relative artifact is a hard
error rather than an unsafe overwrite.

Multi-node jobs use a node-scoped cache directory:

```text
/root/.cache/vllm-ascend/csrc-build-cache/<soc>/node-<worker>
```

The design does not depend on cross-node `flock` behavior.

## Persistent transport and trust

The restore and save composite actions own the fixed Huawei OBS transport
configuration. The cache engine has no storage API or credential knowledge.

Read access follows the runner's existing OBS authorization. Shared writes
require both `HW_OBS_AK` and `HW_OBS_SK`; possession of those secrets is the
only write-authorization boundary. The save action receives the credentials
explicitly from trusted callers and skips publication when either is absent.

Only the central csrc producer publishes L1 in this integration. Image and
release-wheel Docker builds retain their existing behavior and do not restore,
export, or save persistent L1.

Source-consuming jobs are read-only L1 consumers: they may restore a compatible
snapshot before their existing source installation, but they do not publish.
Exact-artifact consumers use the central L0 output; an L0 miss continues to the
ordinary source build without making persistent L1 transport a prerequisite.
Local compilation remains correct but does not create a shared snapshot.

A writer publishes only after a successful build creates or replaces a local
entry. OBS restore and save failures remain performance degradations.

## Failure behavior

| Condition | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Historical source has no cache engine | Report unsupported and continue with the ordinary build. |
| Snapshot environment cannot be fingerprinted | Skip L1 restore and continue with the ordinary build. |
| Snapshot restore fails | Continue with an empty local L1. |
| Entry is absent, unparsable, or has an object manifest that fails validation | Compile and replace it. |
| Manifest is valid JSON with a non-object top level | Currently raises during validation; this is an outstanding cache-engine defect. |
| Entry lock is unavailable | Bypass the entry and compile. |
| Local entry save fails | Warn and keep the successful build output. |
| Snapshot save fails | Keep the successful build or verified L0 artifact. |
| Compiler command fails | Fail the build. |
| Artifact ownership collides | Fail rather than overwrite another action's output. |
| Action or publish synchronization fails | Fail when continuing could corrupt shared output. |

Operational JSONL events are limited to cache results, warnings, and lock
contention. Observability is best effort and never serializes compilation.

## Integration patterns

### Direct source consumers

Source-consuming jobs restore L1 before their existing source installation and
do not publish. Exact-artifact jobs use the canonical producer's L0 output; an
L0 miss proceeds through their existing source build without a second direct
L1 fallback, except where a caller explicitly enables the optional shared-L1
fallback. Selected-test jobs use that optional fallback after an L0 miss;
other L0 consumers, including scheduled upstream E2E, retain their caller-
specific source-build policy.

### Local source builds

Ordinary local source builds use the same action cache in the repository's
ignored `csrc/build_cache` directory. This is local-only acceleration: no OBS
credentials or remote snapshot transport are involved. Set
`VLLM_ASCEND_BUILD_CACHE_DIR` to an absolute path to override this local
default; CI supplies an explicit directory and is unaffected by the
repository-local location. Deleting the local directory causes a cold build;
it does not change the compiled source or CI's persistent snapshot.

### Central producer

The reusable producer restores L1, performs the ordinary source build, verifies
final native artifacts, publishes changed L1 state, and then publishes the
exact L0 artifact.

### Historical sources

Main2Main and bisect-style builds keep current workflow helpers separate from
the selected source tree. A historical tree without `build_cache.py` reports
`supported=false` and builds normally.

### Docker builds

Image and release-wheel workflows are not L1 consumers or writers in this PR.
Their existing Docker build, source compilation, and image L0 behavior remain
unchanged. A later integration must validate the Docker boundary without
embedding persistent L1 in a published image.

## Validation summary

| Capability | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Action identity, entries, and failure behavior | cache-engine unit tests |
| Concurrent ownership and lock behavior | concurrency unit tests |
| Direct source reuse | A2, A3, and 310P cold/warm runs |
| Selective invalidation | operator-local mutation with unrelated HITs |
| Root-independent semantic identity | schema-4 CASE-C regression |
| Persistent producer | cold/warm producer runs |

Some exact production callers still require release credentials, caller
registration, or multi-node allocation. Structural and component evidence does
not replace those caller-specific runtime gates.

## Operational debugging

For an unexpected full MISS, compare schema, snapshot compatibility,
`prepared_input_hash`, `recipe_hash`, and `compiler_environment_hash` in entry
manifests. For broad selective invalidation, inspect the prepared-input set and
operator namespace. For historical source, check the restore action's
`supported` output.

# Speculative Decoding KV Sliding Window

Speculative decoding draft models are typically trained on short contexts
(e.g. 4-8K tokens). At inference time, when the running context grows far
beyond the training length, the draft's attention over the full KV cache goes
out-of-distribution and acceptance collapses: on GLM-5.2 with an early DSpark
draft, the mean acceptance length dropped from ~5 to ~1 at 32K context, making
speculation a net loss.

The KV sliding window caps the **draft model's attention** to the most recent
`draft_window_size` tokens. The target model is untouched - it always attends
to the full context, so generation quality is preserved; only the draft reads
a shorter, in-distribution window. On acceptance-collapsed drafts this
restores acceptance (the same GLM-5.2 draft recovered from ~1.0 to ~4.7-5.5
at 32K, up to +381% end-to-end throughput in the original evaluation).

## Configuration

The window is enabled through `additional_config` and is available for the
EAGLE3 / DFlash / DSpark draft paths on the default (MRV1) model runner:

```json
{"draft_window_size": 2048}
```

It is disabled by default (key absent). MTP force-disables it (MTP reuses the
target's own layers, so windowing the draft would window the target); for a
DSpark draft that was natively trained together with a DeepSeek-V4 target, a
warning is logged because the draft is already long-context stable and
windowing degrades acceptance.

## Window math

Let `W` be the window size, `b` the kernel block size, `K = future_offset`
the number of draft query positions lying beyond the `seq_lens` value the
adapter sees. The adapter computes, entirely on device:

```text
start        = floor(clamp(seq_lens + K - W, min=0) / b) * b   # block-aligned window start
windowed_len = seq_lens - start                                # <= W + b - 1
start_block  = start // b
needed       = ceil(windowed_len / b)  (capped at max_window_blocks = W//b + 1)
```

`future_offset` differs by draft family because their `seq_lens` semantics
differ:

| Method | future_offset | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| EAGLE3 | `num_speculative_tokens` | `seq_lens` is context-only; the K draft positions lie beyond it, so the window end must cover `seq_lens + K`. |
| DFlash / DSpark | `0` | the input-preparation kernel already bakes the query stretch (bonus + mask tokens) into `seq_lens`, so `final = seq_lens`. |

The block table is cropped by gathering columns
`start_block[i] + [0, max_window_blocks)` from the full table into a
zero-padded clone; columns past `needed` (and past the full-table width) are
zeroed. Zeroed columns are never read because every FIA KV-length input is
capped at the same `windowed_len`.

Two invariants hold throughout:

- **slot_mapping is never windowed.** Draft KV writes still go through the
  full block table at absolute positions, so the cache stays coherent for the
  target model and for window sizes changed between steps.
- **Only what FIA reads is capped.** The FIA kernel's KV-length inputs are the
  NPU `seq_lens` tensor plus CPU mirrors (`seq_lens_cpu`, `_seq_lens_cpu`,
  `seq_lens_cpu_upper_bound`); all of them are windowed with the same
  arithmetic so no path can read past the window.

## MRV1 implementation

`SlidingWindowAdapter` (`vllm_ascend/spec_decode/utils.py`) owns the math
above and a persistent `[max_num_reqs, max_window_blocks]` clone buffer. It is
constructed in `AscendSpecDecodeBaseProposer.__init__`
(`vllm_ascend/spec_decode/llm_base_proposer.py`) when `draft_window_size` is
set, then applied to the draft's `common_attn_metadata` **before** the
per-layer metadata is built.

There are two apply points because of how the drafts construct metadata:

- EAGLE3 / DFlash: applied once in `_propose` on the shared
  `common_attn_metadata` (`llm_base_proposer.py`).
- DSpark: that path is bypassed - the dspark branch of
  `build_draft_attn_metadata` overwrites
  `common_attn_metadata.block_table_tensor` with a per-group full table before
  building. The adapter is therefore applied **after** the per-group overwrite
  and before `builder.build_for_drafting`, so FIA reads the windowed clone of
  the per-group table instead of the full one.

## MRV2 status

Model Runner V2 is not yet covered by this feature. The MRV2 speculator
system bakes `seq_lens` / block tables into the final per-layer metadata
inside `build_attn_metadata` - there is no shared `common_attn_metadata` to
mutate after the build, so porting the window requires applying it to the
**builder inputs** (windowed `input_buffers.seq_lens`, gathered per-group
block-table clones, capped `seq_lens_cpu_upper_bound`) around the
`_build_draft_attn_metadata` call in
`vllm_ascend/worker/v2/spec_decode/dspark/speculator.py`. The window math
and the two invariants above carry over unchanged.

## Expected behavior

- Drafts trained on short contexts that collapse on long inputs (acceptance
  dropping with context length): the window restores acceptance up to the
  draft's short-context level. The gain grows with input length.
- Drafts already stable at long context (recently trained drafts, or drafts
  with their own SWA structure): the window provides no benefit and can hurt
  if set **below** the draft's training window - the draft expects to see
  more context than the window allows. Rule of thumb: keep
  `draft_window_size` at or above the draft's training/native window, or
  leave it off when acceptance is already flat across context lengths.
- End-to-end effect combines the acceptance change with the draft's reduced
  KV-read cost; with no acceptance gain the two roughly cancel.

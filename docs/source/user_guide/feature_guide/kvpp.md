# KVPP (Experimental)

## Overview

KVPP (KV pipeline parallelism) distributes historical KV caches that would otherwise be replicated across TP ranks by layer for non-hybrid MLA/SFA models. This reduces persistent cache storage per rank, allowing the same HBM capacity to accommodate more context tokens or concurrent requests.

When a layer executes, the rank responsible for its cache broadcasts the complete cache to the other ranks in the group. Model computation retains its TP/EP/PP configuration. With PP enabled, each stage assigns caches and broadcasts within its own cache-replica group. The group spans TP ranks, or PCP × TP ranks when PCP is enabled on Model Runner V2, and never crosses DP replicas or PP stages.

The pipeline parallelism in KVPP refers to KV cache storage and communication, while model computation keeps the parallel configuration described above. For the underlying layer-wise KV storage concept, see **LayerSplit** in Z.ai's [Scaling Pain of Coding Agent Serving: Lessons from Debugging GLM-5 at Scale](https://z.ai/blog/scaling-pain).

## Use Cases

KVPP targets long-context inference and concurrent serving workloads where duplicated KV caches limit the available cache capacity. It can also be combined with prefix caching and KV pooling for workloads with reusable long prefixes.

On 950DT Products, the measured KV cache capacity was **6.25×** with GLM-5.2-W4A8C8 on one eight-device node using TP8 + EP, and **5.35×** with GLM-5.2-W8A8C8-mxfp8 on two eight-device nodes using TP8 + PP2 + EP (38/40 layers). Each comparison uses the same model, hardware, and memory budget with KVPP off and on. These capacity ratios are specific to the configurations in the performance section; they are not throughput multipliers or guarantees for other models.

## Supported Scenarios

### Supported Models

KVPP supports non-hybrid MLA and SFA models with Model Runner V1 and V2. Combining KVPP with PCP requires Model Runner V2.

| Attention backend | KVPP support | Model scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MLA | ✅ Supported | Non-hybrid models using MLA |
| SFA | ✅ Supported | Non-hybrid models using SFA, such as GLM-5.2 |

Models must also meet the hardware, quantization, and attention-backend requirements of vLLM Ascend.

### Supported Features

The following table lists individual feature combinations with KVPP. It does not imply that all listed features can be enabled together.

| Feature or combination | Support | Conditions and limitations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Eager mode | ✅ Supported | Use `--enforce-eager`. |
| Graph mode | ❌ Not supported | KVPP currently requires eager mode. |
| TP | ✅ Supported | KV caches are assigned by layer within each cache-replica group. |
| EP | ✅ Supported | Requires an MoE model that supports EP. |

- ✅ **Supported**: The feature combination is supported under the stated conditions.
- ❌ **Not supported**: The combination is not currently supported.

## Usage

Enable KVPP through `enable_kvpp` in `--additional-config`, using eager mode:

```bash
vllm serve <model-path> \
    --tensor-parallel-size 2 \
    --enforce-eager \
    --additional-config '{"enable_kvpp": true}'
```

Replace `<model-path>` with a supported MLA/SFA model path and select TP according to model size and available devices. The KVPP group size follows TP × PCP and requires no separate setting. With PCP disabled, TP=1 provides no cache-sharing benefit across ranks.

If the launch command already contains `--additional-config`, merge `enable_kvpp` into the existing JSON object.

### Combining Features

KVPP can be combined with EP, PP, chunked prefill, prefix caching, and asynchronous scheduling. The following example uses an MoE model that supports EP:

```bash
vllm serve <model-path> \
    --tensor-parallel-size 2 \
    --enable-expert-parallel \
    --enable-chunked-prefill \
    --enable-prefix-caching \
    --async-scheduling \
    --max-num-batched-tokens 32768 \
    --max-num-seqs 12 \
    --enforce-eager \
    --additional-config '{"enable_kvpp": true}'
```

Adjust the token budget and maximum number of sequences to device capacity and workload.

For PCP, set `VLLM_USE_V2_MODEL_RUNNER=1` and add `--prefill-context-parallel-size` to the launch configuration. KVPP shares caches across PCP × TP ranks; Model Runner V1 does not support KVPP with PCP.

For PP, add `enable_kvpp` to the existing PP launch configuration. Each stage allocates its caches independently. KVPP does not change PP layer partitioning.

Fixed-step MTP can be combined with KVPP, but MTP caches remain independently allocated and are excluded from KVPP layer partitioning. Follow the model-specific configuration requirements for MTP launch arguments.

## Configuration Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `additional_config.enable_kvpp` | `false` | Enables KVPP; the group size follows TP × PCP. |
| `--enforce-eager` | Not enabled | Required for KVPP; graph execution is not currently supported. |

KVPP broadcasts each full layer once. No broadcast granularity or separate KVPP parallel size needs to be configured.

## KV Transfer Configuration

### PD Disaggregation

KVPP supports P/D disaggregation through `MooncakeConnectorV2` (**Experimental**). The connector code has been merged but has not yet been released.

Use `MooncakeConnectorV2` with `kv_producer` on the prefill node and `kv_consumer` on the decode node. Enable KVPP only on the prefill node. MTP caches remain replicated and are transferred alongside the persistent target caches.

```bash
# Prefill node: include {"enable_kvpp": true} in --additional-config.
--kv-transfer-config '{"kv_connector":"MooncakeConnectorV2","kv_role":"kv_producer","kv_port":37000}'

# Decode node: leave KVPP disabled.
--kv-transfer-config '{"kv_connector":"MooncakeConnectorV2","kv_role":"kv_consumer","kv_port":37010}'
```

Each worker uses a handshake port derived from `kv_port` and its parallel rank. Choose non-overlapping port ranges when both nodes run on one host.

### Memcache Pooling

KVPP supports `kv_producer` and `kv_both` for Memcache pooling. `kv_consumer` has not been tested and is outside the validated support scope.

Configure the memcache SDK and MetaService as described in [KV Pool](kv_pool.md), then add:

```bash
--kv-transfer-config '{"kv_connector":"AscendStoreConnector","kv_role":"kv_producer","kv_connector_extra_config":{"lookup_rpc_port":"0","backend":"memcache","use_layerwise":false,"load_async":true}}'
```

The example uses `kv_producer`; you can also set `kv_role` to `kv_both`. Both roles save and load prefixes in this pooling configuration. Keep `use_layerwise=false`, `load_async=true`, and `discard_partial_chunks=true` (the default). Layerwise pooling, KV events, and consumer write-back are not supported with KVPP.

Each TP rank saves one complete object per token block containing its persistent target layers and its own MTP caches. Scratch buffers are excluded. Loading restores those same persistent buffers; the existing KVPP broadcast supplies other ranks when a layer executes. Pool lookup requires every nonempty owner shard across all PP stages.

## Performance

The following measurements of GLM-5.2 on 950DT Products show the impact on cache capacity, time to first token (TTFT), and prefill throughput. The single-node and dual-node deployments use different quantized weights; compare KVPP on and off within each deployment.

### Test Configuration

| Setting | Single node | Dual-node PP |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hardware | One node with 8 950DT Products | Two nodes with 8 950DT Products per node |
| Model | GLM-5.2-W4A8C8 | GLM-5.2-W8A8C8-mxfp8 |
| Parallelism | TP8 + EP | TP8 + PP2 + EP, 38/40 layer split |
| Common settings | DSA-CP, chunked prefill, prefix caching, asynchronous scheduling, LI-C8, Model Runner V1, eager mode | Same as single node |
| Scheduling and memory | `max_num_batched_tokens=32768`, `max_num_seqs=12`, `gpu_memory_utilization=0.90` | Same as single node |

MTP and SFA-C8 were not enabled. All measurements below use a 32K scheduling token budget.

### KV Cache Capacity

The service calculated capacity automatically without a block-count override. Single-node values come from the pooling test configuration; dual-node values come from non-pooling service startup logs.

| Deployment | KVPP disabled (tokens) | KVPP enabled (tokens) | Capacity multiplier | Equivalent KV memory savings at the same token capacity |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Single node | 235,008 | 1,467,904 | 6.25× | 83.99% |
| Dual-node PP | 555,392 | 2,972,416 | 5.35× | 81.32% |

Equivalent KV memory savings are estimated from the capacity ratio and do not represent the same reduction in total HBM usage. Each rank still needs two scratch buffers and independent MTP caches, so capacity gains depend on layer count, TP size, PP partitioning, and per-layer cache sizes.

### Time to First Token

This test measures long-input, zero-prefix-hit, low-concurrency requests. The single-node deployment uses GLM-5.2-W4A8C8 with eight 950DT Products and TP8 + EP. The dual-node deployment uses GLM-5.2-W8A8C8-mxfp8 with eight 950DT Products per node and TP8 + PP2 + EP (38/40 layers). Other service settings follow the test configuration above.

Input lengths are 32K, 64K, and 128K tokens. Prefix cache hit rate was 0%, with 1 output token. Each result is the mean TTFT of 4 requests at client concurrency 1. A positive change indicates increased latency.

| Deployment | Input length | KVPP disabled | KVPP enabled | TTFT change |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Single node | 32K | 2.623 s | 2.614 s | -0.33% |
| Single node | 64K | 5.295 s | 5.375 s | +1.52% |
| Single node | 128K | 10.901 s | 11.268 s | +3.36% |
| Dual-node PP | 32K | 2.900 s | 2.905 s | +0.19% |
| Dual-node PP | 64K | 4.503 s | 4.887 s | +8.53% |
| Dual-node PP | 128K | 7.805 s | 8.665 s | +11.01% |

### Non-Pooling Prefill Throughput

Each run contained 40 requests at client concurrency 12, with 128K input tokens and 1 output token per request. KV pooling was disabled in both configurations.

| Deployment | Prefix cache hit rate | KVPP disabled (input tokens/s) | KVPP enabled (input tokens/s) | Throughput change |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Single node | 0% | 12,492.4 | 12,205.7 | -2.30% |
| Single node | 90% | 116,516.2 | 110,224.8 | -5.40% |
| Dual-node PP | 0% | 21,395.2 | 18,742.3 | -12.40% |
| Dual-node PP | 90% | 177,375.4 | 154,717.3 | -12.77% |

The actual hit rate in all 90% scenarios was 89.9414%. Under these workloads, KVPP increased cache capacity while adding broadcast overhead; non-pooling throughput did not improve.

## Usage Recommendations

Evaluate KVPP first on workloads limited by KV cache capacity. Compare capacity, TTFT, and throughput with KVPP on and off using realistic input lengths, concurrency, and prefix distributions, then select a configuration that meets the service latency requirements.

Broadcasts transfer all allocated logical blocks of a layer without filtering for active requests, so increasing cache capacity also increases broadcast volume. Prefetching can overlap part of the communication with computation, but the benefit remains workload-dependent. When cache capacity is already sufficient, use measured latency and throughput to decide whether to enable KVPP.

# Ascend Store Deployment Guide

## Environmental Dependencies

* Software:
    * Python >= 3.10, < 3.12
    * CANN == 8.3.rc2
    * PyTorch == 2.8.0, torch-npu == 2.8.0
    * vLLM：main branch
    * vLLM-Ascend：main branch

### KV Pool Parameter Description

**kv_connector_extra_config**: Additional Configurable Parameters for Pooling.  
**lookup_rpc_port**: Port for RPC Communication Between Pooling Scheduler Process and Worker Process: Each Instance Requires a Unique Port Configuration.  
**load_async**: Whether to Enable Asynchronous Loading. The default value is false.  
**backend**: Set the storage backend for kvpool, with the default being mooncake.

### Environment Variable Configuration

To guarantee uniform hash generation, it is required to synchronize the PYTHONHASHSEED environment variable across all nodes upon enabling KV Pool.

```bash
export PYTHONHASHSEED=0
```

## Example of using Mooncake as a KV Pool backend

* Software:
    * Check NPU HCCN Configuration:

        Ensure that the hccn.conf file exists in the environment. If using Docker, mount it into the container.

        ```bash
        cat /etc/hccn.conf
        ```

    * Install Mooncake

        Mooncake is the serving platform for Kimi, a leading LLM service provided by Moonshot AI.
        Installation and Compilation Guide: <https://github.com/kvcache-ai/Mooncake?tab=readme-ov-file#build-and-use-binaries>.
        First, we need to obtain the Mooncake project. Refer to the following command:

        ```shell
        git clone -b v0.3.7.post2 --depth 1 https://github.com/kvcache-ai/Mooncake.git
        ```

        (Optional) Replace go install url if the network is poor

        ```shell
        cd Mooncake
        sed -i 's|https://go.dev/dl/|https://golang.google.cn/dl/|g' dependencies.sh
        ```

        Install mpi

        ```shell
        apt-get install mpich libmpich-dev -y
        ```

        Install the relevant dependencies. The installation of Go is not required.

        ```shell
        bash dependencies.sh -y
        ```

        Compile and install

        ```shell
        mkdir build
        cd build
        cmake .. -DUSE_ASCEND_DIRECT=ON
        make -j
        make install
        ```

        Set environment variables

        **Note:**

        * Adjust the Python path according to your specific Python installation
        * Ensure `/usr/local/lib` and `/usr/local/lib64` are in your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`

        ```shell
        export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib64/python3.11/site-packages/mooncake:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
        ```

### Run Mooncake Master

#### 1.Configure mooncake.json

The environment variable **MOONCAKE_CONFIG_PATH** is configured to the full path where mooncake.json is located.

```shell
{
    "metadata_server": "P2PHANDSHAKE",
    "protocol": "ascend",
    "device_name": "",
    "master_server_address": "xx.xx.xx.xx:50088",
    "global_segment_size": "1GB" (1024MB/1048576KB/1073741824B/1073741824)
}
```

**metadata_server**: Configured as **P2PHANDSHAKE**.  
**protocol:** Must be set to 'Ascend' on the NPU.
**device_name**: ""
**master_server_address**: Configured with the IP and port of the master service.  
**global_segment_size**: Registered memory size per card to the KV Pool.

#### 2.Start mooncake_master

Under the mooncake folder:

```shell
mooncake_master --port 50088 --eviction_high_watermark_ratio 0.9 --eviction_ratio 0.1
```

`eviction_high_watermark_ratio` determines the watermark where Mooncake Store will perform eviction，and `eviction_ratio` determines the portion of stored objects that would be evicted.

### PD Disaggregation Scenario

#### 1.Run `prefill` Node and `decode` Node

Using `MultiConnector` to simultaneously utilize both `MooncakeConnectorV1` and `AscendStoreConnector`. `MooncakeConnectorV1` performs kv_transfer, while `AscendStoreConnector` serves as the prefix-cache node.

`prefill` Node：

```shell
bash multi_producer.sh
```

The content of the multi_producer.sh script:

```shell
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/Ascend/ascend-toolkit/latest/python/site-packages:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export PYTHONHASHSEED=0 
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/xxxxx/vllm
export MOONCAKE_CONFIG_PATH="/xxxxxx/mooncake.json"
export ASCEND_RT_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3
export ACL_OP_INIT_MODE=1

# ASCEND_BUFFER_POOL is the environment variable for configuring the number and size of buffer on NPU Device for aggregation and KV transfer，the value 4:8 means we allocate 4 buffers of size 8MB.
export ASCEND_BUFFER_POOL=4:8

# Unit: ms. The timeout for one-sided communication connection establishment is set to 10 seconds by default (see PR: https://github.com/kvcache-ai/Mooncake/pull/1039). Users can adjust this value based on their specific setup.
# The recommended formula is: ASCEND_CONNECT_TIMEOUT = connection_time_per_card (typically within 500ms) × total_number_of_Decode_cards.
# This ensures that even in the worst-case scenario—where all Decode cards simultaneously attempt to connect to the same Prefill card the connection will not time out.
export ASCEND_CONNECT_TIMEOUT=10000

# Unit: ms. The timeout for one-sided communication transfer is set to 10 seconds by default (see PR: https://github.com/kvcache-ai/Mooncake/pull/1039).

Currently, the key-value pool in PD Disaggregate only stores the kv cache generated by the Prefill node by default. In models using MLA, it is now supported that the Decode node stores the kv cache for use by the Prefill node, enabled by adding `consumer_is_to_put: true` to the AscendStoreConnector. If the Prefill node enables PP, `prefill_pp_size` or `prefill_pp_layer_partition` also needs to be set. Example as follows:

```python
{
    "kv_connector": "AscendStoreConnector",
    "kv_role": "kv_consumer",
    "kv_connector_extra_config": {
        "lookup_rpc_port":"0",
        "backend": "mooncake"
        "consumer_is_to_put": true,
        "prefill_pp_size": 2
        "prefill_pp_layer_partition": "30,31"
    }
}
```

#### 2、Start proxy_server

```shell
python vllm-ascend/examples/disaggregated_prefill_v1/load_balance_proxy_server_example.py \
    --host localhost\
    --prefiller-hosts localhost \
    --prefiller-ports 8100 \
    --decoder-hosts localhost\
    --decoder-ports 8200 \
```

Change localhost to your actual IP address.

#### 3.Run Inference

Configure the localhost, port, and model weight path in the command to your own settings.

Short question:

```shell
curl -s http://localhost:8000/v1/completions -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{ "model": "/xxxxx/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct", "prompt": "Hello. I have a question. The president of the United States is", "max_completion_tokens": 200, "temperature":0.0 }'
```

Long question:

```shell
curl -s http://localhost:8000/v1/completions -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{ "model": "/xxxxx/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct", "prompt": "Given the accelerating impacts of climate change—including rising sea levels, increasing frequency of extreme weather events, loss of biodiversity, and adverse effects on agriculture and human health—there is an urgent need for a robust, globally coordinated response. However, international efforts are complicated by a range of factors: economic disparities between high-income and low-income countries, differing levels of industrialization, varying access to clean energy technologies, and divergent political systems that influence climate policy implementation. In this context, how can global agreements like the Paris Accord be redesigned or strengthened to not only encourage but effectively enforce emission reduction targets?

```

### PD-Mixed Inference

#### 1.Run Mixed Department Script

```shell
bash mixed_department.sh
```

Content of mixed_department.sh:

```shell
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/Ascend/ascend-toolkit/latest/python/site-packages:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

        "backend": "mooncake"
    }
}' > mix.log 2>&1
```

#### 2.Run Inference

Configure the localhost, port, and model weight path in the command to your own settings. The requests sent will only go to the port where the mixed deployment script is located, and there is no need to start a separate proxy.

Short question:

```shell
curl -s http://localhost:8100/v1/completions -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{ "model": "/xxxxx/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct", "prompt": "Hello. I have a question. The president of the United States is", "max_completion_tokens": 200, "temperature":0.0 }'
```

Long question:

```shell
curl -s http://localhost:8100/v1/completions -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{ "model": "/xxxxx/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct", "prompt": "Given the accelerating impacts of climate change—including rising sea levels, increasing frequency of extreme weather events, loss of biodiversity, and adverse effects on agriculture and human health—there is an urgent need for a robust, globally coordinated response.

```

Note: For MooncakeStore, it is recommended to perform a warm-up phase before running actual performance benchmarks.

This is because HCCL one-sided communication connections are created lazily after the instance is launched when Device-to-Device communication is involved. Currently, full-mesh connections between all devices are required. Establishing these connections introduces a one-time time overhead and persistent device memory consumption (4 MB of device memory per connection).

**For warm-up, it is recommended to issue requests with an input sequence length of 8K and an output sequence length of 1, with the total number of requests being 2–3× the number of devices (cards/dies).**

## Example of using Memcache as a KV Pool backend

### Installing Memcache

**MemCache depends on MemFabric. Therefore, MemFabric must be installed.Installing the memcache after the memfabric is installed.**

* **memfabric_hybrid**: <https://gitcode.com/Ascend/memfabric_hybrid/tree/master/doc/build.md>

* **memcache**: <https://gitcode.com/Ascend/memcache/blob/master/doc/build.md>

### Configuring the memcache Config File

    config Path：/usr/local/memcache_hybrid/latest/config/
    **Configuration item description**：<https://gitcode.com/Ascend/memcache/blob/develop/doc/memcache_config.md>

    Set TLS certificate configurations. If TLS is disabled, you do not need to upload a certificate. If TLS is enabled, you need to upload a certificate.

```shell
# mmc-meta.conf
ock.mmc.tls.enable = false
ock.mmc.config_store.tls.enable = false

# mmc-local.conf
ock.mmc.tls.enable = false
ock.mmc.config_store.tls.enable = false
ock.mmc.local_service.hcom.tls.enable = false
```

You are advised to copy mmc-local.conf and mmc-meta.conf to your own path and modify them, and set the MMC_META_CONFIG_PATH environment variable to the path of your own mmc-meta.conf file.

**Key Focuses：**

* ock.mmc.meta_service_url：Configure the IP address and port number of the master node. The IP address and port number of the P node and D node can be the same.
* ock.mmc.local_service.config_store_url：Configure the IP address and port number of the master node. The IP address and port number of the P node and D node can be the same.
* ock.mmc.local_service.world_size：Total number of cards for starting services.
* ock.mmc.local_service.protocol：host_rdma (default), device_rdma (supported for A2 and A3 when device ROCE available, recommended for A2), device_sdma (supported for A3 when HCCS available, recommended for A3)
* ock.mmc.local_service.dram.size：Sets the size of the memory occupied by the master. The configured value is the size of the memory occupied by each card.
* To disable TLS authentication modification, set the following parameters to false:：ock.mmc.meta.ha.enable、ock.mmc.config_store.tls.enable

### Memcache environment variables

```shell
source /usr/local/memcache_hybrid/set_env.sh
source /usr/local/memfabric_hybrid/set_env.sh
# Configuring Environment Variables in the Configuration File
export MMC_META_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/memcache_hybrid/latest/config/mmc-meta.conf
```

### Run Memcache Master

Starting the MetaService service.

```shell
1. Set environment variables for the configuration file.
export MMC_META_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/memcache_hybrid/latest/config/mmc-meta.conf

2. Access the Python console or compile the following Python script to start the process:
from memcache_hybrid import MetaService
MetaService.main()
```

Method 2 for starting the MetaService service.

```shell
source /usr/local/memcache_hybrid/set_env.sh
source /usr/local/memfabric_hybrid/set_env.sh
export MMC_META_CONFIG_PATH=/home/memcache/shell/mmc-meta.conf # Set it to the path of your own configuration file.
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/python3.11.10/lib/
/usr/local/memcache_hybrid/latest/aarch64-linux/bin/mmc_meta_service
```

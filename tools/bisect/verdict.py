"""Normalise a trial run into PASS / FAIL / SKIP.

Note: a benchmark *baseline/threshold* miss is recorded in the results JSON's
``pass_fail`` field but does NOT (unless ``benchmark_comparisons`` is enabled)
make pytest exit non-zero. So a perf/accuracy regression is only visible by
reading the JSON -- we must check both signals, not just the exit code.

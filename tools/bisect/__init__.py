"""Auto-Bisect tooling for nightly E2E test failures.

Given a failing nightly test case, this package binary-searches the
``vllm-ascend`` commit history between the last-known-good commit and the
currently failing commit to pinpoint the first bad commit (and the PR it
belongs to). It deliberately reuses the existing nightly launch entries
(``test_single_node.py`` / ``common/multi_node/run.sh``) so that the bisect
reproduces the exact nightly environment.

"""Pytest configuration for ``scripts/`` unit tests.

The ``select_tests`` module stores ``runner_mapping`` in a module-level
global that is normally populated by ``main()`` from the routing config.
Tests that exercise the routing internals directly need this global
to be set. The :func:`_load_runner_mapping` autouse fixture loads the real
``test_config.yaml`` once before each test, so internal-function tests work
in isolation.

End-to-end tests that call ``main()`` with their own config still need to
include ``runner_mapping`` in that config (see ``_write_config``).
